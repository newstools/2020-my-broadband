Google has announced that its Chat app will get dark theme support. The new feature, which will be available on both Android and iOS, does not require any action from users, as it will automatically respect your Android system settings. “Dark theme is a popular feature that’s frequently requested by users,” said Google. “It creates a better viewing experience in low-light conditions by reducing brightness.” Google said that this new feature will roll out over the next two weeks, and will be available to all G Suite customers. Google Chat is the latest of several Google apps to get support for dark mode. The company also recently updated its Docs, Sheets, and Slides apps on Android to support its Android dark theme. As is the case with Google Chat, these apps automatically adjust themselves based on the device’s Android system settings. However, these can also manually be set to use dark mode independently to the settings used by the Android operating system. To do this, the user must navigate to Menu > Settings > Theme > Dark from within the app. It is unclear if this is also the case with its Chat app. University of Cambridge academic Silas Brown previously highlighted the following benefits of dark modes for users: There are also negatives to dark modes, however, including dark mode being harder to use when there is lots of external light, or if the text is small.
