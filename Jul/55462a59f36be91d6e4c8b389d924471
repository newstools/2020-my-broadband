MSI is a name synonymous with awesome gaming products, and their latest Z490 motherboards prove why. With years of experience, MSI is no stranger to building high-performance motherboards. These Z490 motherboards not only optimise the performance of your other components, they are also designed with the latest technology and advanced cooling to achieve maximum performance. This is thanks to MSI’s Core Boost and state-of-the-art memory technologies to ensure your CPU and RAM remains stable even when they are being overclocked. MSI’s range of powerful Z490 motherboards cater to a variety of gamers and power users – allowing you to pick the perfect board for your system. MSI Z490 motherboards are built with between 6 and 10 PCB layers which ensure reliable circuit transmission, higher bandwidth and faster transfer speeds across the entire MSI Z490 motherboard lineup. These motherboards are also already Lightning Gen4 ready. The MEG motherboard range are seasoned record breakers due to their premium power design, and the MEG Z490 Godlike builds on this legacy by offering extreme performance. The MEG Z490 Godlike supports 10th-generation Intel processors and DDR4 RAM which, through Interdigital Tabbed Routing and isolated circuitry, can operate at up to 5,000MHz when overclocked. All MSI Z490 motherboards feature Core Boost technology, however the MEG class models exclusively feature a mirrored power arrangement to release ultimate performance. Through Thunderbolt 3, the Z490 Godlike also offers bandwidth speeds of up to 40Gbps, while dual CPU power connectors help you get the most performance out of your processors. To keep temperatures down, the Z490 Godlike features an advanced cooling solution which ensures that you can push your components to the max without worrying about overheating. This includes the state-of-the-art Frozr heatsink design, total software-driven fan controls, and an innovative heat-pipe design. All models in the MEG class feature active cooling with double ball bearings and Zero Frozr technology. Connectivity isn’t a problem, either – 10G Super LAN, 2.5G LAN on all Z490 models, and Wi-Fi 6 AX support means that you can access lightning-fast speeds when gaming online. The Z490 Godlike also features a Dynamic Dashboard that is DIY Friendly and can be customized with .GIF images using a colorful OLED display that shows system information, debug functions and other information. The motherboard also features pre-installed I/O Shielding to make installation more convenient for system builders. <img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-360071" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/MSI-Motherboard-1-640x402.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="402" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/MSI-Motherboard-1-640x402.jpg 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/MSI-Motherboard-1-600x377.jpg 600w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/MSI-Motherboard-1-768x483.jpg 768w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/MSI-Motherboard-1-1200x754.jpg 1200w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/MSI-Motherboard-1.jpg 1321w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> <img class="aligncenter wp-image-360079" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/MSI-Motherboard-2-1-631x430.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="436" /> <img class="aligncenter wp-image-360061" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/MSI-Motherboard-3-565x430.png" alt="" width="640" height="487" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/MSI-Motherboard-3-565x430.png 565w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/MSI-Motherboard-3-526x400.png 526w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/MSI-Motherboard-3-768x584.png 768w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/MSI-Motherboard-3.png 1091w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> The MEG Z490 Unify leverages the record-breaking knowledge of the MEG team, but without the flashy RGB lighting.

Both of these solutions offer a variety of benefits, including quieter operation than their competitors, compatibility with an extensive array of motherboards, fantastic RGB lighting, and market-leading cooling. The CoreLiquid 360R and 240R are AIO liquid cooling products that utilise a split pathway through the radiator to dissipate heat quickly. These liquid cooling products are designed to be use in a variety of ways on MSI motherboards – including as a CPU cooler, a waterblock cooler, a top system fan, a front system fan, and a rear system fan. This is enabled by strategically positioned pin-header locations on different areas of the motherboard. Both liquid coolers feature a design constructed from high quality materials that remain durable and deliver unstoppable cooling performance, even under extreme operating conditions. Wreak havoc without sacrificing style with the intuitive 270-degree rotating blockhead inlaid with a deep aggressive aesthetic and ARGB lighting. MSI’s CoreLiquid series feature a unique design where the pump has been integrated into the radiator for sound dampening and noise reduction. The durable three phase motor at the core of the pump generates minimal vibrations for long-lasting operation with a motor ceramic bearing that has been designed to provide up to 100,000 hours life expectancy. <img class="aligncenter wp-image-360045" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/MSI-Cooler-1-619x430.png" alt="" width="641" height="445" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/MSI-Cooler-1-619x430.png 619w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/MSI-Cooler-1-576x400.png 576w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/MSI-Cooler-1-768x533.png 768w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/MSI-Cooler-1.png 1195w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> <img class="aligncenter wp-image-360043" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/MSI-Cooler-2-619x430.png" alt="" width="641" height="445" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/MSI-Cooler-2-619x430.png 619w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/MSI-Cooler-2-576x400.png 576w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/MSI-Cooler-2-768x533.png 768w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/MSI-Cooler-2.png 1195w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> <img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-360041" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/MSI-Cooler-3-640x251.png" alt="" width="640" height="251" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/MSI-Cooler-3-640x251.png 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/MSI-Cooler-3-600x235.png 600w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/MSI-Cooler-3-768x301.png 768w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/MSI-Cooler-3-1536x602.png 1536w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/MSI-Cooler-3-1200x470.png 1200w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/MSI-Cooler-3.png 1920w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> <img class="aligncenter wp-image-360039 size-large" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/MSI-COoler-4-640x284.png" alt="" width="640" height="284" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/MSI-COoler-4-640x284.png 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/MSI-COoler-4-600x266.png 600w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/MSI-COoler-4-768x341.png 768w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/MSI-COoler-4-1536x682.png 1536w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/MSI-COoler-4-1200x533.png 1200w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/MSI-COoler-4.png 1869w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> The motherboards listed above are just a few of the versions available in the extensive MSI Z490 range.
