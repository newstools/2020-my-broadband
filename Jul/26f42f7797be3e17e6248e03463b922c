Samsung has released the first official trailer for its Galaxy Unpacked August 2020 event. The video includes a teaser of what looks to be the silhouettes of five upcoming devices.

Here is a breakdown of what to expect from each device according to the latest leaks. The latest information from multiple reports indicates that there will be two Galaxy Note 20 models – a standard and Ultra edition.
