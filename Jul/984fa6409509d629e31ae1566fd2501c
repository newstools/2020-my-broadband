Axxess has launched its new Just DSL service, which offers a standalone ADSL or VDSL connection. What makes this service so attractive is that you do not need to pay for a voice line from Telkom to get this connection – which results in savings of over R200 per month. If this isn’t enough reason to sign up for Just DSL, the connection you get has no usage thresholds – meaning it is uncapped, unshaped, and unthrottled. You can therefore use as much data as you like without worrying about slower speeds or running out of data. Beyond this unlimited connection, there are a number of other great benefits you will get when you sign up to Axxess Just DSL. These include: You can also purchase a DSL router from Axxess if you don’t already have one. Axxess offers a choice between the Zyxel AMG1302-T11C for R499, or the Zyxel VMG1312-B10D for R899. The new Just DSL service from Axxess offers speeds ranging from 4Mbps to 40Mbps. These are priced as follows: Clients who sign up for Just DSL with Axxess will not have to pay any setup fees.
