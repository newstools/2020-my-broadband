Tablets are ideal for using office productivity tools with lower performance requirements, watching video content, and keeping kids entertained with games and educational material. Huawei recently unveiled its latest entry into the tablet market – the MatePad T8 – which is set to compete against devices including Samsung’s Galaxy Tab A 8.0. We’ve compared these two entry-level tablets to see which offers the best hardware and features. Both the MatePad T8 and Galaxy Tab A feature 8.0-inch displays with 800 x 1,280 resolutions. However, the MatePad T8 employs an IPS TFT display, whereas the Galaxy Tab A uses a standard TFT TN panel. This means the T8’s display has a better response time, wider viewing angle, higher brightness levels, and more vibrant colours. The MatePad T8’s display also has thinner bezels at the top, bottom and sides of the display, providing it with around an 80% screen-to-body-ratio. In terms of build material, both tablets employ plastic bodies and frames, with metal lids on the back. The T8 comes in a Deep Sea Blue colour, while the Galaxy Tab A 8.0-inch is available in silver or black. The MatePad T8 is powered by an octa-core MediaTek MT8768 processor, whereas the Galaxy Tab A comes with a quad-core Snapdragon 429 chip. Benchmarks performed by My Next Tablet have shown that the MatePad’s processor outperforms the Galaxy Tab A’s chip. With both tablets paired with 2GB RAM, users should expect superior performance from the T8. For taking photos and videos, each tablet includes a single rear and front camera. The Huawei MatePad T8 has a 5MP lens on the rear, and 2MP sensor for selfies, while the Galaxy Tab A has an 8MP camera on the back and 2MP lens on the front. The MatePad T8’s front camera supports facial recognition for biometric unlocking of the tablet. Both tablets have the same 5,100mAh battery packs, which should be sufficient for an entire day of intensive use. Both tablets come with microUSB ports for charging, but only the T8’s port supports USB On-The-Go charging. This means you can connect flash drives, digital cameras, or other input and output devices directly to easily transfer files or transmit data. Both the MatePad T8 and Galaxy Tab A have a local retail price of R2,999. However, every purchase of the Huawei MatePad T8 from the Huawei online store adds a free tablet cover and Huawei Bluetooth speaker. Below are the specifications and images of the Huawei MatePad T8 and Galaxy Tab A 8.0-inch. <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-359759" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Samsung-Galaxy-Tab-A8.0.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="430" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Samsung-Galaxy-Tab-A8.0.jpg 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Samsung-Galaxy-Tab-A8.0-595x400.jpg 595w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Samsung-Galaxy-Tab-A8.0-300x202.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" />
