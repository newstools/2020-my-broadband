The production department struggled with down time for large file downloads, posing a challenge for productivity. “We had issues sending print-ready files to print and receiving files from freelancers and other co-publishers,” said Jonathan Dhlomo, of Jacana’s accounts department. The publishing house also needed remote and managed IT support to provide seamless communication across the business. When seeking out a suitable service provider to check all the boxes on their list of challenges, Dhlomo said they wanted a reliable service, but affordability was a key factor as well. Enter Vox.
