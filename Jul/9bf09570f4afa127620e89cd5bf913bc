Ubisoft revealed more details about several of its biggest upcoming games during its Ubisoft Forward digital event on Sunday. Popular franchises like Assassin’s Creed, Far Cry, and Watch Dogs were the highlights of the event, and the public beta for the publisher’s entrant into the battle royale genre – Hyper Scape –  was also launched. Assassin’s Creed fans got their first taste of official gameplay footage for Assassin’s Creed: Valhalla, which is set during the Viking invasion of England. A five-minute trailer explained the basic elements of gameplay, while a subsequent 30-minute walkthrough delved deeper into the mechanics. Players will take on the role of Viking warrior Eivor, launching attacks from longships on Saxon troops and fortresses, and raiding them for resources to build their own settlement. The game will use RPG mechanics which allow players to shape their character and influence the world around them. Assassin’s Creed: Valhalla will be released on 17 November for PC, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and Google Stadia. After first teasing it on Friday, Ubisoft officially announced Far Cry 6 with two cinematic trailers showing the basic premise and setting of the game. Far Cry 6 is set on the tropical island of Yara, a Cuban-like country ruled by ruthless dictator Antón Castillo, played by Breaking Bad actor Giancarlo Esposito. Players will take on the role of Yaran local Dani Rojas as they fight in a modern-day guerilla revolution. The game will be available on 18 February for PC, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X, and Google Stadia. Ubisoft also announced that the third entry in its Watchdogs series will be released on PC, PlayStation 4, and Google Stadia on 29 October. One of the interesting mechanics of Watch Dogs: Legion will allow players to recruit and play as any of the NPCs occupying the game’s open-world setting of London.
