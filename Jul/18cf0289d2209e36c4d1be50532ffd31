COVID-19 Recovery Consulting has released a COVID 19 Risk Index which provides details on the risks of everyday activities during the pandemic. “As businesses begin to reopen and you resume your daily life after COVID-19 closures, use our Risk Index to determine the safety levels of your favourite activities,” the company said. This risk index follows the publication of similar charts from the Arizona Department of Health Services and the Texas Medical Association (TMA). The risk level of contracting COVID-19 from different activities vary based on four main factors: The most dangerous activities are indoor parties, night clubs and bars, contact sports, public transport, air travel, concerts, religious services, theatres, and watching sports matches. Medium- to high-risk activities include exercising in a gym, going to a hairdresser or nail salon, working in an office, and visiting a restaurant. Medium risk activities include visiting a hospital, going to the dentist, taking a metered taxi or Uber, visiting a museum, and outdoor restaurant dining. Low- and low/medium-risk activities are staying at home, walking outdoors, picking up fast-food, running, cycling, picnics, tennis, golf, and shopping. The World Health Organisation and the South African Department of Health have released the following guidelines to reduce your chances of being infected or spreading COVID-19: People are also advised to follow good respiratory hygiene, which includes covering your mouth and nose with your bent elbow or tissue when you cough or sneeze. Even if you have minor symptoms such as cough, headache, mild fever, you should stay home and self-isolate until you recover. Health Minister Dr Zweli Mkhize has recently announced the isolation period for patients confirmed to have contracted COVID-19 has been reduced from 14 days to 10 days. He said the change is based on evidence that most patients with mild COVID-19 infections continue to share the virus from their upper airways for approximately seven to 12 days. The table below provides an overview of the risk of contracting COVID-19 from various activities based on three main sources: The table also shows whether these activities are currently allowed in South Africa under the latest alert level 3 lockdown regulations. <img class="aligncenter wp-image-361001 size-large" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/COVID-19-Risk-Index-640x363.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="363" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/COVID-19-Risk-Index-640x363.jpg 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/COVID-19-Risk-Index-600x340.jpg 600w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/COVID-19-Risk-Index-768x435.jpg 768w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/COVID-19-Risk-Index-1536x871.jpg 1536w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/COVID-19-Risk-Index-2048x1161.jpg 2048w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/COVID-19-Risk-Index-1200x680.jpg 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> <img class="aligncenter wp-image-361007" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Covid-19-Risk.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="826" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Covid-19-Risk.jpg 744w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Covid-19-Risk-310x400.jpg 310w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Covid-19-Risk-333x430.jpg 333w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> <img class="aligncenter wp-image-361003" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Arizona.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="619" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Arizona.jpg 754w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Arizona-414x400.jpg 414w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Arizona-445x430.jpg 445w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" />
