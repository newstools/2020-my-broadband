Nvidia Corp. is close to surpassing Intel Corp. in market value for the first time after shares of the graphics chipmaker soared this year. Nvidia has gained more than 70% in 2020 as investors bet the coronavirus pandemic has accelerated a shift to cloud-based digital services that use its technology. The rally has added more than $100 billion in value, giving Nvidia a market capitalization of about $245 billion. Intel has a market value of $249 billion and its shares are down roughly 2% so far this year. The milestone would make Nvidia the third-largest chipmaker by market capitalization, after Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. and Samsung Electronics Co. <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-359111" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Nvidia-market-value-July-2020.jpg" alt="Nvidia market value July 2020" width="814" height="457" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Nvidia-market-value-July-2020.jpg 814w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Nvidia-market-value-July-2020-600x337.jpg 600w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Nvidia-market-value-July-2020-640x359.jpg 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Nvidia-market-value-July-2020-768x431.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" />
