MSI is launching six powerful new laptops with the latest hardware packed into award-winning designs. MSI’s new machines feature up to a 10th-gen Intel Core-i9 processor and GeForce RTX 2080 Super graphics, to put them at the peak of laptop performance. The mighty 2020 laptop line-up coming to South Africa includes the following: MSI’s current GF63 Thin laptop has also been updated with the latest 10th-gen Intel-H Series processor. Below is an overview of three of these exciting new MSI notebooks. The new GS66 Stealth succeeds the popular GS65 Stealth and now comes in a sharp and understated Core Black design. This makes for a mature-looking laptop that appears at home in both the office and your gaming room. Don’t let its sleek appearance fool you into thinking it comes with tame performance, however. It can run the latest 10th-gen Core-i9 H-series processor and an RTX 2080 Super Max-Q, making it capable of reaching the high frame rates supported by its 300Hz display. To keep the system cool, it boasts MSI’s exclusive Cooler Boost Trinity+ with 0.1 mm blades to maximize airflow while using maximum power. <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-359489" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/MSI-GS66-Stealth-final.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="407" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/MSI-GS66-Stealth-final.jpg 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/MSI-GS66-Stealth-final-600x382.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> For those who prefer the “look at my machine, it was born to game” profile, the GE66 Raider’s design exemplifies a true gamer aesthetic. It features a spaceship-like chassis and Mystic Light with mesmerising 16.8 million RGB aurora lighting. It can also be configured with a super-fast 300Hz display and will keep running for longer while unplugged, as it packs a massive 99.9Wh battery. <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-359491" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/MSI-GE66-Raider-final.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="407" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/MSI-GE66-Raider-final.jpg 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/MSI-GE66-Raider-final-600x382.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> Content creators don’t need to look any further than MSI’s Creator 17 laptop, the first of its kind to feature a Mini LED Display. The display easily outperforms IPS and OLED competitors with its wide colour gamut, high contrast and peak brightness of 1,180 nits. Combine the display with a top-of-the-line 10th-gen Intel processor and GeForce RTX 2080 Super graphics and you can unleash unstoppable creative power. These attributes make it ideal for precision-editing and 3D design while on the go. <img class="aligncenter wp-image-359495 size-full" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/MSI-Creator-17-final-e1594358422625.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="406" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/MSI-Creator-17-final-e1594358422625.jpg 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/MSI-Creator-17-final-e1594358422625-600x381.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> If ultimate performance and stunning design isn’t enough, MSI is adding even more value with qualifying purchases of its gaming laptops.
