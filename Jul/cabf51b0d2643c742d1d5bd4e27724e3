Mobile downloads, usage, and spend surged to never-before-seen levels in the second quarter of 2020, according to the latest data from app intelligence firm App Annie. The group’s report showed a marked increase in time spent on both gaming and non-gaming mobile applications, driven largely by the COVID-19 pandemic. “As we continue to track the impact of the coronavirus across key industries and markets, one central thread emerges: people are leaning on mobile, now more than ever, during this difficult time,” App Annie stated. Monthly time spent on apps grew by over 40% year-on-year and peaked at a monthly all-time high of more than 200 billion hours in April. India, Italy, Indonesia and the US have seen their usage grow by 35%, 30%, 25%, and 15%, respectively. “This significant increase in usage was fuelled by social distancing and lockdown measures undertaken throughout the world to combat the spread of the coronavirus pandemic,” App Annie noted. The graph below shows the average monthly hours spent on mobile apps worldwide for each quarter from Q2 2019. <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-359647" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Average-monthly-hours-spent-on-apps-Q2-2020-App-Annie.jpg" alt="Average monthly hours spent on apps - Q2 2020 - App Annie" width="640" height="360" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Average-monthly-hours-spent-on-apps-Q2-2020-App-Annie.jpg 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Average-monthly-hours-spent-on-apps-Q2-2020-App-Annie-600x338.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> A total of nearly 35 billion new apps were downloaded from the Google Play Store and Apple App Store in Q2 2020.

Consumer spend on iOS increased 15% to $17 billion year-over-year, and 25% on Google Play to $10 billion. “Non-gaming apps accounted for 35% of consumer spend on iOS and 15% on Google Play, largely due to in-app subscriptions,” App Annie noted.
