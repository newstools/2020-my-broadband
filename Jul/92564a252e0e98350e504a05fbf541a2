MyBroadband has launched a 2020 Customer Experience Survey. The survey provides you with the opportunity to share your views on what you would like from South African companies and their customer-facing teams and systems. The survey will only take 2 minutes to complete, and your feedback will provide valuable insight into the customer experience segment in South Africa. By taking part in the survey, you also stand a chance to win cool prizes. Prizes up for grabs are: an Amazon Echo and a 20,000mAh power bank. To enter the prize draw: complete the survey and then state “Done” in this forum thread.
