The Department of Employment and Labour in the Western Cape has closed the Hisense TV and appliance factory in Atlantis, a community approximately 50km north of the Cape Town CBD. In a recent statement, the department said it conducted an inspection at the factory on 22 July and found Hisense to be in contravention of the Occupational Health and Safety Act. After a walk around the facility, inspectors reported that the company did not follow some of the basic principles associated with the Act and COVID-19 regulations. Hisense could not produce an updated risk assessment that spoke to the latest COVID-19 regulations, nor could it produce any sanitising plan. As a result, the Department of Employment and Labour served a prohibition notice on the plant. “Prohibition notices essentially means that no work may take place at the premises where the notice was served,” the department stated. “The Department had no option but to close the entire plant due to non-compliances.” Upon further investigation, inspectors found that a group of Chinese workers were crammed into a small space which ignored social distancing principles. A temporary boardroom was used to house a different group of employees, also contravening social distancing regulations. In addition to social distancing concerns, inspectors also reported ventilation issues due to staff being cordoned off. They also reported observing that there was no equal distribution of personal protective equipment at the company. David Esau, the Provincial Chief Inspector, said that Hisense is one of the major employers in the area and its non-compliance with COVID-19 regulations may have a detrimental effect on the whole community. “As part of reversing the prohibition notice, the employer must provide evidence that processes have been put in place to address all the concerns raised,” said Esau. In addition to the prohibition notice, the department also placed the Hisense factor under review as the company could not produce any Employment Equity compliance documents. It was given notice to produce evidence of compliance within 14 days. Hisense employs approximately 400 workers, of which 37 are foreign workers, the department reported. The department stated that Occupational Health and Safety inspectors will conduct a follow-up visit once Hisense has confirmed that all minimum standards have been put in place to ensure the safety of all its employees. If the inspector is satisfied with Hisense’s efforts, the prohibition notice will be lifted. Last year, the Ministry of Trade and Industry welcomed Hisense’s investment of a further R72 million into its television and fridge production lines at its Atlantis factory, bringing its total investment in the plan to R440 million. In March 2019, the plant was said to have created permanent employment for over 500 people. MyBroadband contacted Hisense for comment, but the company did not respond by the time of publication.
