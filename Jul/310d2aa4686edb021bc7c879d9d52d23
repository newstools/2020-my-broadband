OTTs, content players, carriers, mobile network operators, and ISPs already using WIOCC’s network in South Africa, and those who are yet to do so, now have access to a new 16Tbps OTN backbone following a multi-million dollar investment by the pan-African connectivity wholesaler to significantly expand its national hyperscale network. The ongoing global pandemic has driven a very significant and rapid rise in demand for bandwidth, with many more South Africans now working from home and accessing services and applications in the cloud. The use of bandwidth-hungry social media platforms is continuing to expand quickly, whilst personal online entertainment – video and music streaming applications and online gaming – is also growing. The combined impact of these factors is that backbone capacity requirements are increasingly being measured in multiples of 100Gbps, not just the single- or small double-digit capacities of the recent past. Other important capacity provision considerations include: Dynamic changes in end-user demands – such as those triggered recently by Covid-19 – highlight the competitive importance of working with a connectivity supplier for whom scalability and flexibility (both operational and commercial) are second nature, as these factors determine the ability of your business to respond quickly to and exploit (or mitigate against) change. WIOCC’s unique connectivity proposition offers service providers the ability to become more responsive to their customers’ needs by moving their traffic onto a flexible and scalable, hyperscale national network, with access to an extensive network of Metro PoPs and international connectivity to key global hubs: “For many years, WIOCC have provided high-speed fibre connectivity in our Metro core, and IP-Transit facilities. We have also worked together to bring greater capacity and throughput on our key business nodes.”  – Owen Rogers, Broadlink Find out how you can get more from your capacity provider by contacting WIOCC at info@wiocc.net.
