The Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) has launched an online store to sell “revolutionary regalia”, but shoppers trying to access the ecommerce site will be disappointed. The EFF announced the launch on 10 July, stating that the initiative was pioneered by talented young professionals. It added that it is the first of its kind in the political arena and that it is part of the modernisation of the EFF. “The EFF Online Merchandise Store is a sophisticated and easy to use system that allows EFF members, supporters and followers to purchase EFF regalia through an online system,” it said. The party said that customers who purchase products through the EFF store can choose to have the items delivered or collect their purchases from the EFF warehouse in Johannesburg. There are, however, a few problems with the launch. This includes confusion regarding the correct domain and the fact that the official domain does not work. The official EFF website links to the online store domain https://effonlinestore.co.za/. This domain, however, does not have a website hosted on it. People trying to access this store is met with the message “This site can’t be reached. effonlinestore.co.za’s server IP address could not be found”. A cached version of this webpage was indexed by Google on 12 July and appears to show that an online store was previously hosted on this domain but has since become inaccessible. This cached page lists a number of products available for sale – including beanies, berets, black track pants, boot sneakers, and red jackets. The domain which is listed in its promotional material – http://effonlinestore.org/ – redirects to the domains.co.za hosting service. MyBroadband asked the EFF for comment, but the party did not respond by the time of publication. The screenshots below provide an overview of what people trying to access the EFF online store are greeted with. Update: Soon after the article was published the EFF fixed its online store, which is live now. <img class="aligncenter wp-image-359877 size-large" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/EFF-Online-Store-Promotion-640x371.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="371" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/EFF-Online-Store-Promotion-640x371.jpg 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/EFF-Online-Store-Promotion-600x348.jpg 600w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/EFF-Online-Store-Promotion-768x445.jpg 768w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/EFF-Online-Store-Promotion.jpg 937w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> <img class="aligncenter wp-image-359879" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/EFF-Online-Store.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="434" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/EFF-Online-Store.jpg 663w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/EFF-Online-Store-589x400.jpg 589w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/EFF-Online-Store-634x430.jpg 634w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/EFF-Online-Store-300x202.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> <img class="aligncenter wp-image-359881" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/EFF-Online-Store-Org.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="461" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/EFF-Online-Store-Org.jpg 881w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/EFF-Online-Store-Org-555x400.jpg 555w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/EFF-Online-Store-Org-597x430.jpg 597w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/EFF-Online-Store-Org-768x554.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" />
