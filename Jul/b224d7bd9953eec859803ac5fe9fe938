Many businesses are currently facing the challenge of monitoring their remote workforce, as it’s something they’ve never previously had to do – particularly large corporations with a workforce of hundreds or thousands of employees. The challenge of monitoring a remote workforce includes managing runaway business data and other telecom expenses. Without managing these expenses effectively, companies may be overspending on telecoms and face financial risk. Visibill is a Telecom Expense Management System which provides visibility into your company’s telecom expenses, giving you immediate insights and reporting to help you identify data trends and capacity within your organisation while being able to maximise long-term savings. Developed by Rysis Software in South Africa, the cloud-based web application enables enterprises to control, manage, and understand their telecom expense situation from anywhere. The system is easy to use and clearly shows where spend is allocated, allowing teams to take action on telecom expenses as needed. The system is setup to integrate directly with South African mobile operators, giving administrators full visibility into the expenditure of employees’ SIM cards. The Visibill system is easy to access as it is a cloud-based web application. It also offers usage notifications which can be set up via SMS or email to notify you once usage has reached a preset threshold and prevent unwanted expenditure. With Visibill your itemised billing is also imported directly from your service provider and processed by Visibill so that your subscriber, package, and invoice information is available on their system. You can also allocate and administer lines effortlessly and almost instantly – all on one centralised dashboard – and the system updates automatically every day. <img class="aligncenter wp-image-359835 size-large" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Top-Features-1-640x333.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="333" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Top-Features-1-640x333.jpg 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Top-Features-1-600x312.jpg 600w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Top-Features-1-768x399.jpg 768w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Top-Features-1.jpg 971w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> Visibill also offers additional functionality such as line locking and data inhibition, data usage analysis and customisation by APN, and budgeting per cost centre. Visibill also integrates with a RADIUS server, which means that when you use an APN, you can provision and de-provision SIMs off that server immediately, and control spend there. Each employee with a cellphone line can log onto the system and will be able to see their own line. Because of Visibill’s built-in organisational structure, each business unit or department will also be able to see what their department is spending and make adjustments based on this. What’s more is that Rysis can adjust, customise, and integrate the Visibill product into existing systems based on your business requirements. Visibill also offers a 30-day termination notification – which means there are no long-term binding contracts. Interested parties can also test the system for a month through Visibill’s obligation-free proof of concept before making any commitment.
