Lagging data and limited cell signal are frequent problems in South Africa. There are many contributing factors to poor signal, but it usually comes down to one of the following causes: physical distance from the cell tower, external obstructions such as trees, hills, mountains, valleys, or dense foliage (especially pinecones). One of the leading causes of obstruction is also the fact that you want to get reception inside a building and the building itself or the layout of the building (e.g. your home or office), reduces the signal. Fortunately, solutions exist for all types of buildings across South Africa, and we’ve created this list of recommended solutions that will improve your call reception or data connection. Whether you’re in a remote area with poor cellphone signal inside your house or in a large city with hard-to-penetrate buildings, our recommended antennas and signal boosters get the job done. They’ll extend your network signal with low-cost options for up to 1,000m2 coverage – depending on your product model and outside signal strength. If you are looking for an easy-to-install, unobtrusive antenna, have a look at the XPOL-1 Series of antennas from Poynting Antennas. The XPOL-1-5G is the latest, innovative, wideband antenna in this series, which will be available from August. <img class="aligncenter wp-image-361938 size-large" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/1-3-640x336.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="336" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/1-3-640x336.jpg 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/1-3-600x315.jpg 600w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/1-3-768x403.jpg 768w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/1-3.jpg 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> The all new XPOL-1-5G is the second-generation version of the popular XPOL-1 Antenna. The new version is a cross-polarised, omni-directional antenna that offers clients a future-proof, wide band option that performs exceptionally well across 2G, 3G, 4G and 5G frequencies. The antenna offers 2×2 MIMO capability and a 4×4 MIMO option. The 4×4 variant can be used for a 4×4 router or in a dual 2×2 modem. The XPOL-1-5G antenna also has a variety of mounting options to make the installation process easy. The antenna can be wall or pole mounted to be used as an outdoor antenna or the antenna can be window mounted with the help of suction cups. The new XPOL-1-5G antenna is expected to be wildly popular amongst those seeking a wideband solution to improve signal for a variety of applications, and is the perfect cost-effective, 5G futureproof solution to bring signal directly to a variety of LTE or Mi-Fi devices. To improve signal in a building for both voice and data or where a very weak signal exists, we would recommend the use of a signal booster in conjunction with an antenna to amplify the weak signal and broadcast strong signal in your home or office. Poynting recommends products from the WilsonPro and weBoost line, manufactured by Wilson Electronics in the US and locally distributed by Bolton Technical. The Wilson Electronics Line of weBoost and WilsonPro Signal Boosters boast the following features: <img class="aligncenter wp-image-361928 size-large" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/2-4-640x336.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="336" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/2-4-640x336.jpg 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/2-4-600x315.jpg 600w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/2-4-768x403.jpg 768w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/2-4.jpg 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> The weBoost AH100-PP or “Plug and Play” kit is an easy-to-install signal booster option for spot coverage with up to 50dB gain. It’s a no-drilling, no-fuss unit that anyone can set up within a couple of minutes. It comes with a window or pole mountable omni-antenna and a cable can be brought in through the window and plugged straight into the booster. The stylish Wilson Desktop Antenna can be placed on a cabinet or desk and will transmit the stronger signal within a room. The unit can also be taken with you wherever you go for a truly portable signal booster solution. The Plug and Play kit is an economical option if you’re on a budget and only need spot coverage, for example at a desk or work station. It’s also a great option if you need to stabilise your Mi-Fi/Wi-Fi router which relies on a SIM card for Internet connectivity. <img class="aligncenter wp-image-361930 size-large" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/3-1-640x336.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="336" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/3-1-640x336.jpg 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/3-1-600x315.jpg 600w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/3-1-768x403.jpg 768w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/3-1.jpg 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> The WeBoost Home AH100-Pro Signal Booster is an affordable, yet versatile solution, fully capable of improving your indoor cellular signal. The kit comes with a 50db gain amplifier and is paired with a powerful indoor and external antenna. It covers up to a maximum of up to 150m2 depending on the outside signal strength. Its cable can be brought into the home or office via a window for an easy installation – requiring no drilling. When purchased with an optional vehicle expansion kit, it doubles as a vehicle signal booster for your car, SUV, 4×4 or caravan. <img class="size-large wp-image-361932 aligncenter" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/4-1-640x336.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="336" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/4-1-640x336.jpg 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/4-1-600x315.jpg 600w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/4-1-768x403.jpg 768w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/4-1.jpg 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> The WilsonPro A500 Cell Phone Signal Booster is the most popular cellular booster for average-size homes and offices. 75% of customers who’ve purchased one have found it to be the right fit for them, so it’s usually the first one Poytning recommends for medium-sized home or office coverage. The signal booster can be purchased as a DIY installation kit or can be installed by one of Poynting’s certified installation teams. The powerful amplifier with up to 70dB gain can be paired with various options for indoor and outdoor antennas. It features higher uplink and downlink power than most competitor cell signal boosters, meaning it’s more likely to work well in weaker signal areas. <img class="size-large wp-image-361934 aligncenter" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/5-640x336.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="336" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/5-640x336.jpg 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/5-600x315.jpg 600w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/5-768x403.jpg 768w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/5.jpg 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> For larger homes, offices, warehouses, or commercial buildings this is your best option. The WilsonPro A1000 Cell Phone Signal Booster is the most powerful commercial unit in the WilsonPro range, which provides up to 74dB gain, and is the best option for weak signal areas as it has the highest output performance in the range. It features Automatic Gain Control technology to stabilise signal strength and can cover up to 1,000m2. Depending on the incoming signal strength, the amplifier can be paired with up to 4 internal antennas, and signal can be split to various rooms in a home or office. You won’t beat the power of this unit, and if you are looking for a top-of-the-range performer that is capable of covering a large area you won’t do better than this.
