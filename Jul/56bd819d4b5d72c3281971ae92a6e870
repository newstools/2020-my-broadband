The Department of Transport has published a new gazette which includes a change to the validity period for driver’s licences in South Africa. In particular, the gazette includes detailed information on the revised expiration dates for motor vehicle licence discs, driver’s licences, temporary permits, roadworthy certificates, and others which expired during the lockdown period. Licensing centres across the country have begun to reopen, but many are operating with reduced staff due to COVID-19 restrictions.

The new expiration dates for licenses which originally expired during the lockdown period are shown below: The full gazette is embedded below.
