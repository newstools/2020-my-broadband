An official render of the Google Pixel 4a has leaked on the Google Store ahead of the smartphone’s official launch, according to a report by 9to5Google. The image above, courtesy of 9to5Google, shows that the Googe Pixel 4a will sport a hole-punch front-facing camera placed at the top-left corner of the display, as well as a single camera on the rear of the device. A fingerprint sensor is also placed at the back of the smartphone, and there is a speaker grille at the top of the display. According to the leaked image, Google’s Pixel 4a will retain the uniquely-coloured power button sported by previous generations, with that of the model in the leaked render being green. Other leaked information about the Pixel 4a includes the device’s price and basic specifications. According to the report, this device will be powered by a Qualcomm Snapdragon 730 chipset paired with 6GB of RAM, and it will have 128GB of internal storage. It will also reportedly support 18W wired fast-charging for its 3,080mAh battery. The smartphone will reportedly be unveiled as part of a range of devices that will include the Pixel 4a 5G and Pixel 5 smartphones. It is expected to be priced between $300 and $400 and will be released later this year. Google’s Pixel 4 and Pixel 4 XL smartphones were launched at the company’s Made By Google event in October last year. The devices were the first to use an integrated Soli radar chip, which allows the smartphones to read hand gestures in front of the device. This technology lets users control their handset without directly touching it. Google’s Pixel range of smartphones has historically not been available in South Africa, with the company employing a relatively limited rollout compared with major manufacturers like Samsung and Apple.
