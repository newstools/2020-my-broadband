The Texas Medical Association (TMA) has released a list which ranks activities on a scale of 1 to 10, reflecting how risky they are in terms of exposure to COVID-19 infection. This list is based on the feedback of physicians from the TMA COVID-19 Task Force and the committee on infectious diseases. Over the past few months, a lot of knowledge was gained about the coronavirus and what people can do to prevent the spread of the disease. The World Health Organisation and the South African Department of Health have released guidelines to reduce your chances of being infected or spreading COVID-19. People are also advised to follow good respiratory hygiene, which includes covering your mouth and nose with your bent elbow or tissue when you cough or sneeze. Even if you have minor symptoms such as cough, headache, mild fever, you should stay home and self-isolate until you recover. If you have a fever, cough, and difficulty breathing, you are advised to seek medical attention but call by telephone in advance if possible, and follow the directions of your local health authority. People are further advised to avoid sharing food and other items and avoid indoor gatherings if possible. The TMAâ€™s list, which ranks activities based on COVID-19 risk, corresponds with similar lists released by Reuters and The Washington Post. The table below provides an overview of these three sources on the risk which activities pose in terms of COVID-19 exposure. The higher the Risk Rating (from 1 to 10), the higher the change is that you will get COVID-19 when engaging in this activity. The table also shows whether these activities are currently allowed in South Africa under the latest alert level 3 lockdown regulations.
