MultiChoice Connected Video CEO Niclas Ekdahl has resigned, the company has confirmed to MyBroadband. Connected Video is MultiChoice’s Internet TV division, responsible for its Showmax and DStv Now video streaming services. Following more than 19 years of executive leadership experience in the audio-visual services industry, Ekdahl was appointed to the position in September 2018. He drove several projects at the Connected Video unit during his tenure, including a redesign of the DStv Now interface and the launch of Showmax’s R49 mobile-only plan. Under his leadership, Showmax also recently performed field tests for its standalone streaming service, which will offer DStv content over the Internet without requiring an installed dish or decoder. MultiChoice Group Executive for Corporate Affairs Joe Heshu said Ekdahl decided to leave MultiChoice to “pursue personal interests”. “We are grateful for his contribution in which he oversaw the growth of the Showmax and DStv Now platforms,” Heshu said. CEO of M-Net Africa Yolisa Phahle will take over Ekdahl’s position, in addition to running the General Entertainment division, Heshu confirmed. Ekdahl’s resignation comes just a week after MultiChoice launched Showmax Pro – a video streaming product offering live sports coverage. The service includes all Premier League, Serie A, La Liga, and PSL games as well as a wide range of live sport events such as IAAF Athletics, professional boxing, and the world’s biggest marathons. While it is only available in Kenya and Nigeria at the moment, it is understood that it will roll out to South Africa in the next five to seven weeks. There is no specific date for the South African launch of Showmax Pro, and the company said that sport content and pricing may vary by country.
