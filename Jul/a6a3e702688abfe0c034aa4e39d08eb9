Private online high school Valenture Institute is launching boutique campuses in South Africa. The first South African boutique campus will be opening in January 2021 in Newlands and is designed to allow high school learners to interact with their peers while taking live online classes. “Our boutique private high school campuses provide a unique environment where high-schoolers can interact and collaborate with peers in person while studying in live online classes alongside global classmates,” said Valenture Institute. Valenture Institute said that learners who study through this online high school get the opportunity to connect and engage with experts from organisations like NASA, Google, and Harvard. “Our learning environment encourages group collaboration where students are able to express their personal dreams, goals and aspirations for their future. Our approach is geared towards furthering our students’ individual growth while always considering real-world application.” The campuses will provide learners with personalised guidance from learning coaches and a variety of impressive facilities and services. These include: Valenture also has an additional Cape Town campus set to launch in Constantia, as well as upcoming Johannesburg campuses in Bryanston and Sandton. Globally, it is also developing campuses in London and Boston.
