Connected medical devices help clinicians deliver faster, higher quality care, but they also create an attack surface that most healthcare delivery organisations (HDOs) are not prepared to protect. These devices lack inherent security controls, they cannot easily receive software updates, and they are not seen nor managed by traditional security products. All of this puts sensitive data, day-to-day facility operations, and patient health at risk. Armis is the first agentless, enterprise-class security platform to address the new threat landscape of unmanaged medical and IoT devices. The Armis platform discovers every device (managed, unmanaged and medical) on and off the network and analyses behaviour to identify risks, such as ransomware spread, and can quarantine devices, medical or otherwise, thereby protecting critical patient information and systems from attacks in real-time. “Armis, which is cloud-based, agentless, and integrates easily with existing network and security products, passively monitors wired and wireless traffic on a network and in a medical facility’s airspace to identify every device and to understand their behaviours without disruption. The Armis Risk Engine then analyses this data and uses device profiles and characteristics from the Armis Device Knowledgebase to identify each device, assess their risks, detect threats, and quarantine suspicious malicious devices automatically,” said Andre Kannemeyer, CTO at Duxbury Networking, suppliers of Armis solutions in South Africa. <img class="aligncenter wp-image-358987 size-large" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Duxbury-Networking-CT-scan-640x430.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="430" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Duxbury-Networking-CT-scan.jpg 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Duxbury-Networking-CT-scan-595x400.jpg 595w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Duxbury-Networking-CT-scan-300x202.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> Armis discovers and classifies every medical device, as well as regular managed and unmanaged devices, in the medical environment. It can even identify off-network devices using Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, and other IoT protocols in the environment – a capability no other security product offers without additional hardware. “In addition to discovering and classifying a device, Armis calculates its risk score based on factors like vulnerabilities, known attack patterns, and the behaviours observed of each device on your network. This risk score helps your security team understand your attack surface and meet regulatory requirements to identify and prioritise vulnerabilities,” said Kannemeyer. In addition, device usage and location are critical to the bottom line of any healthcare organisation. “You need to know where they are, how much they are used, or if they are sitting idle. Armis tracks each device, its IP and where it is on the network. It will even let you know if they move between floors or buildings. It also sees traffic and associates use of each device for utilisation reporting, helping you get the best return on investment for your medical assets,” added Kannemeyer. Armis is also a valuable tool in the related field of pharmaceutical and life sciences cyber-security, where three areas of the business lack robust security controls because the devices in these areas are not visible to traditional security tools. “Each of these areas are blind spots for your security team, putting you at greater risk for cyber-attack. The impact could be very serious: “The Armis agentless device security platform allows security teams in the pharmaceutical and life sciences industries to properly secure all connected devices and computing resources—without any disruption to the business. Armis requires no agents or additional hardware to deploy, so it can be up and running in minimal time,” said Kannemeyer. Armis provides the following security benefits: “For security professionals in large organisations within various market sectors looking to protect their company from the ever-expanding threat landscape introduced by unmanaged devices that can’t take an agent, Armis provides the leading agentless device security platform purpose-built to protect the world unmanaged and IoT devices, providing real-time and continuous asset inventory, risk management, detection and response,” said Kannemeyer.
