Eskom has announced that it will implement stage 1 load-shedding on Wednesday 15 July. Stage 1 load-shedding will be suspended at 22:00 on Tuesday and will resume at 09:00 on Wednesday. Eskom said that it has restored two generation units to service, which has helped to significantly reduce the strain on the national power grid. “Today Eskom teams have successfully returned a generation unit each at the Medupi and Majuba power stations to service,” Eskom said. “In addition, unit 2 at Koeberg was synchronised into the grid yesterday.” “This additional capacity has significantly reduced the strain on the generation system,” the power utility said. Eskom said that while this progress has helped, it has not been enough to stop load-shedding altogether. Instead, Eskom will implement stage 1 load-shedding tomorrow – downgrading from the stage 2 load-shedding which it has implemented continuously since Friday 10 July. “Eskom wishes to assure the public that implementing load-shedding is the last resort, in order to protect the national grid,” Eskom said. It also said that the return to service of a power unit each at Tutuka and Kendal power stations has been delayed. Colder weather has also exacerbated demand for electricity, placing more strain on the system, but Eskom said its teams are working around the clock to return as many generation units as possible. “We therefore urge the public to continue assisting us in managing consumption in order to reduce the impact of supply constraints,” Eskom said. It added that it would communicate should there be any significant changes to the power supply situation. #POWERALERT 1 Eskom will implement Stage 1 loadshedding from 09:00 until 22:00 tomorrow pic.twitter.com/OYjNrIDFQa — Eskom Hld SOC Ltd (@Eskom_SA) July 14, 2020
