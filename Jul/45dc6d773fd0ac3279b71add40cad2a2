On Sunday night, President Cyril Ramaphosa announced stricter lockdown regulations to fight the rapid increase in COVID-19 cases in South Africa. These interventions include a new curfew between 21:00 and 04:00 and a ban on alcohol sales and distribution. While the stricter regulations and rise in COVID-19 cases will not change people’s lives much, it means people will continue to spend a lot of time at home. Most professionals will continue to work from home and streaming services like Netflix and Showmax will remain the preferred entertainment platform for people. To support the change in how people work and stay entertained, a fast and stable internet connection is crucial. Since the lockdown was announced in March, Internet service providers (ISPs) have experienced an influx of new orders. While fibre-to-the-home is the preferred connection for most households, not all areas have fibre coverage. People who cannot get fibre have a few other options, like ADSL, VDSL, 4G/LTE, and 5G. So significant is the demand for uncapped broadband that it changed Telkom’s strategy to discontinue its copper services. The COVID-19 pandemic has caused Telkom to continue with ADSL support for the foreseeable future and it has even launched a new wholesale DSL service – Pure Connect. With so many different broadband options, it raises the question which fixed-broadband connections offer the best value-for-money. The table below provides an overview of the different uncapped broadband options available to consumers. For this comparison, one ISP’s (Afrihost) prices were used to ensure a fair comparison.
