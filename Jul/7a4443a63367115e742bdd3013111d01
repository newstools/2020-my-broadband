C has retained its position as the most popular programming language in the world, according to the Tiobe Index for July. Java remains second, comfortably ahead of third-placed Python. The most notable change, however, was in the ranking of statistical programming language R – which has moved to its highest-ever position of 8th. Tiobe said that while Python had previously looked like it had won the battle of statistical programming, R’s increasing popularity continues to pose a threat. It said that there are two key trends that could boost the popularity of the R language moving forward: “Other interesting moves this month are Rust (from #20 to #18), Kotlin (from #30 to #27) and Delphi/Object Pascal (from #22 to #30),” noted Tiobe CEO Paul Jansen. Python remains atop the PYPL rankings with a market share of 31.73%. Java sits comfortably in second, although it saw a 2.7% decrease in market share compared with July 2019. The other big losers within the top 10 were PHP – which dropped a position to C/C++ when compared to July 2019 – and Matlab, which had TypeScript take its position within the top 10 compared to a year ago. The top 10 programming languages for July 2020, according to the Tiobe Index and PYPL rankings, are detailed below.
