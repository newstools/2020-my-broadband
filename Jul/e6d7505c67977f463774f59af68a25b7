Smartphones are becoming increasingly expensive in South Africa, meaning it is worth considering smartphone insurance. All four of South Africa’s major mobile networks offer customers the opportunity to sign up to mobile insurance when purchasing a new smartphone. MTN, Vodacom, and Cell C offer multiple insurance options which range from comprehensive insurance to more specific cover. Telkom offers a single insurance product which provides comprehensive cover for your mobile device. MyBroadband compared the pricing of these insurance products by determining the premiums for the most complete insurance product for four popular smartphones. These smartphones were the Huawei Y9 2019, the Samsung A30s, the iPhone 11 128GB, and the iPhone 11 Pro 256GB. We then used resources provided by the mobile providers to determine the premiums that we would need to pay for each of these smartphones. For Vodacom, we mailed its insurance department to request a quote. Below are the prices for comprehensive insurance products from each of the mobile operators, followed by a detailed breakdown of each company’s products. MTN offers three insurance products – Repair Only, Liquid and Accident, and All Risk. It has a list of the smartphones it sells, and the customer must identify their smartphone from this list on the company’s insurance website. They are then provided the pricing for each of these insurance options for the specific device. <img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-328579" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/MTN-copy-1-640x430.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="430" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/MTN-copy-1.jpg 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/MTN-copy-1-595x400.jpg 595w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/MTN-copy-1-300x202.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> Vodacom offers three insurance types – Comprehensive Insurance, Accidental Damage, and Specified Insured Extras, the latter of which covers accessories such as smartwatches. Both Comprehensive and Accidental insurance prices start at R20 per month, while Specified Insurance Extras starts at R80 per month. Vodacom explained that premiums are set in accordance with the risk profile of customers, which it said ensures customers are treated fairly. “We use a number of variables and factors to model the expected claims, and regularly monitor the actual versus expected results. This means that our prices are both highly accurate and competitive,” said Vodacom. Vodacom provided us with approximate pricing for the devices we requested – with the caveat that this would change in accordance with each customer’s risk profile. <img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-350608" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Vodacom-Logo-640x430.jpg" alt="Vodacom Logo" width="640" height="430" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Vodacom-Logo.jpg 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Vodacom-Logo-595x400.jpg 595w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Vodacom-Logo-300x202.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> Cell C offers various insurance products depending on the customer’s requirements.
