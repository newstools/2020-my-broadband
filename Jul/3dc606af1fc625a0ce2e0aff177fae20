MultiChoice has announced that it has rolled out Showmax Pro to 40 new countries in Africa. However, South Africa is not included among this list of new countries to gain access to MultiChoice’s newest digital streaming product. Showmax told MyBroadband that it aims to launch the service in South Africa before the end of August. The pricing for the Pro version of the streaming service in these 40 new countries is as follows: These 40 countries join Kenya and Nigeria in having access to Showmax Pro – with the latter two countries getting access to the service on 7 July. Showmax had previously confirmed that following the launch of the service in Kenya and Nigeria, it would roll out to additional countries across sub-Saharan Africa within 6-8 weeks. Showmax Pro offers users a variety of additional content alongside the traditional Showmax entertainment service. This content includes music channels, news, and live sport streaming. Sport offered on Showmax Pro includes all Premier League, Serie A, La Liga, and PSL games, as well as an extensive selection of additional live sport events including IAAF athletics, global marathons, and professional boxing. The table below details the Showmax Pro offering. According to Media Monitoring Africa director William Bird, South Africans should expect popular sports like rugby and cricket to be available on the South African version of Showmax Pro. While he could not provide a price estimate for the South African version of this package, Bird expects it will be similar to and competitive with DStv’s existing packages. Most of the live sports offered on the version of Showmax Pro accessible to the current 42 supported countries are available on either DStv Compact or DStv Compact Plus in South Africa, which are priced at R399 and R529 per month, respectively. DStv Premium, which includes rugby and cricket broadcasting, is priced at R819 per month.
