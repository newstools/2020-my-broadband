South Africans are watching more content online due to the COVID-19 lockdown. MultiChoice said that active Showmax users have increased by 50% while play events have more than doubled since pre-lockdown peaks. Active user numbers typically lull on Wednesday and Thursday, and build up from Friday until a peak on Sunday. However, during the lockdown this has not been the case. “There was a significant divergence from Monday 15 March,” MultiChoice said. “On that day, instead of the number of active customers dropping off, it stayed almost at the Sunday peak and then started rising for six days straight.” The company told MyBroadband that live news is the most-watched content on its platform at the moment. It said it was able to repurpose the live streaming capability it had developed for sport and redeploy it at short notice for eight news channels. “We’ve also seen a big spike in news viewing on DStv Now and on the DStv Now free service which is available to non-subscribers,” it said. “We’ve also created edutainment content rows to help parents, and we’re even adding yoga and other exercise programming.” <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-339853" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Showmax-prepaid-headline.jpg" alt="Showmax prepaid headline" width="640" height="430" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Showmax-prepaid-headline.jpg 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Showmax-prepaid-headline-595x400.jpg 595w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Showmax-prepaid-headline-300x202.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> Netflix offers a section on its platform which outlines the top 10 TV shows and movies in South Africa each day.

Netflix, YouTube, and Amazon have all implemented these changes, while local MultiChoice streaming services DStv Now and Showmax have followed suit. “We’ve limited the maximum resolution for both Showmax and DStv Now live streaming to 576p on our mobile apps,” MultiChoice said. No changes were made to browser, TV, or decoder-based streaming, but MultiChoice said it would take further measures if necessary.
