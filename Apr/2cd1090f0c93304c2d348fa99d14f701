South African gamers who are stuck at home during the 21-day lockdown and looking for new games to play during this period of isolation – look no further. There are several high-quality games that are set to launch during the lockdown period. These games are listed below. The popular Resident Evil series gets its latest remake with the updated version of Resident Evil 3. While the game is based on the same storyline as the original Resident Evil 3, it will offer several improvements, including significantly enhanced graphics.  Another remake of a popular game launching in April is Final Fantasy VII. While only a portion of the main story from the original game will be available – taking place exclusively in Midgar – the game’s developer Square Enix said new side quest content will be as large as the main story. Game co-director Tetsuya Nomura also said that the portion of the original main story that will be playable will includes expanded quests intended to give characters more depth.  The controversial Fallout 76 will finally get one of the features that it was criticised for excluding in the original game – NPCs. “Two vying factions are struggling to gain the upper hand as the secrets of West Virginia are revealed.
