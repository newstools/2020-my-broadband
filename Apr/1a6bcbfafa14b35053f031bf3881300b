The national lockdown in South Africa has highlighted the value of a fast, uncapped Internet connection. Many families will spend at least a month at home, with the parents working from home and the kids watching Netflix, playing games, and learning online. Using multiple bandwidth-intensive services like streaming or video conferencing simultaneously requires a high-speed service. This is where fibre really shows its value. While many ADSL and wireless users are complaining about poor service levels, fibre users have no problems. Uncapped fibre-to-the-home is the preferred connectivity service for South African households, and for good reason. Fibre is more affordable than ADSL and it gives users a wide range of speed options ranging between 10Mbps and 1Gbps. Supersonic – winner of the Best ISP in South Africa award in 2019 – makes it easy and affordable for people to move to uncapped fibre. For those who cannot get fibre, it also offers excellent fixed-LTE products over MTN’s award-winning network. Further good news is that Supersonic’s call centre continues to operate during the lockdown, with its employees working from home.
