The president said there would be a big increase in testing for the virus over the next few weeks in order to identify and isolate the infected. Communities across the country will be screened, he stated. He said this was necessary to contain the spread of the virus and avoid a massive loss of life in South Africa. Department of Health acting director-general Anban Pillay recently told Rapport that there were not enough tests being done in South Africa, which is inhibiting the country’s ability to combat the virus. Pillay told Parliament that not enough tests are being done to get a real picture of the coronavirus pandemic in South Africa. Rapport added that the National Health Laboratory Service (NHLS) confirmed that test kits ordered three weeks ago from the USA had not arrived in the country yet. These tests kits are needed to increase South Africa’s daily testing capability from 5,000 to 30,000 per day.
