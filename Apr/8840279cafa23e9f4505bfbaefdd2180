Discovery has informed its medical aid scheme members they can apply to have their monthly fees paid for from their medical savings account. “For members who are on health plans with a medical savings account (MSA), Discovery Health Medical Scheme will allow members with a sufficient MSA balance to use their positive balance to pay for their total medical scheme contribution for up to three months,” states the Discovery website. “A positive MSA refers to the ‘cash’ balance and does not include the upfront MSA you get at the start of the calendar year.” Discovery said it will pay a member’s total medical scheme contribution from their MSA and adjust the MSA balance accordingly. “You may not choose to partially pay for your contributions from your MSA balance,” stated the website. Discovery stated that members can apply for up to three months of “contribution concession”. “Individuals with a positive MSA balance equivalent to at least one month’s medical scheme contributions may apply to access this option, with no suspension imposed on their membership for this period.” Users apply on the Discovery website after logging into their online profile, and then submit their contact information. Members are also presented with a list of terms linked to the payment concession. Members are also offered a “Vitality Premium concession with limited benefits”. “You can choose to keep your Vitality membership active with limited benefits for the same contribution relief period indicated above,” stated the website. “Your affected benefits and premiums will be reinstated at the end of the concession period. Note that your Vitality premium will not be deducted effective from the following month, and it will not be paid from your positive Discovery Health Medical Scheme MSA.”
