TCL Communication has launched its first range of premium smartphones – the TCL 10 series. The Chinese company is known for manufacturing affordable high-quality TVs, which has seen it compete globally with the market leaders in this space, Samsung and LG. The company last year launched the TCL Plex, a mid-range smartphone which received positive reviews for its high-quality display and good performance at an affordable price (€300/R6,030). TCL’s new line-up of smartphones comes with TCL-made high-resolution displays and NXTVISION visual technology, as well as Qualcomm Snapdragon processors and quad-camera systems. Headlining the range is the TCL 10 5G, which boasts a Snapdragon 765G processor paired with 6GB of RAM. The chip supports integrated 5G connectivity, allowing the smartphone to connect to both sub-6GHz and mmWave 5G networks. It features a 6.53-inch FHD+ LCD display with a hole-punch cutout for its 16MP selfie camera, giving it a 91% screen-to-body ratio. Its quad-camera system boasts a 64MP main sensor, 118-degree 8MP ultra-wide camera, 5MP macro lens, and 2MP Bokeh sensor. Storage is only available in 128GB but can be expanded with up to a 256GB microSD card. The smartphone boasts 2.5D front glass and 3D back glass and will be available in two colours – Chrome Blue and Mercury Grey. The premium TCL 10 Pro boasts an upgraded display compared with the TCL 10 5G, as it sports an AMOLED panel a with an in-display fingerprint reader. Additionally, it has better photography capabilities thanks to a larger 24MP front camera and 16MP ultra-wide sensor. The 10L is the most affordable of the three smartphones and comes with a mid-range Snapdragon 665 processor paired with 6GB of RAM. It also offers a quad-camera system on the rear and a 16MP front camera. The entry-level variant ships with 64GB of internal storage. TCL stated that the TCL 10 5G will be available in “select regions” around the world later this year for €399 (R8,020). The 10 Pro will start at €449 (R9,025), while the entry-level 10L will be priced at €249 (R5,005). The latter two smartphones will be launched in Europe, North America, Australia, and the United Kingdom in Q2 2020.
