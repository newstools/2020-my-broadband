A document titled “Risk-adjusted strategy for economic activity” is proposing criteria for a return to economic activity based on a 5-level alert system. The document was published on the Southern African Tourism Services Association website to inform its members of the proposal. “The South African Government has developed a risk-adjusted strategy for economic activity, including tourism and hospitality,” it said. According to a report on Fin24, presidential spokesperson Khusela Diko said the document was prepared “as early input into the development of a risk-adjusted approach to resuming economic activity”. Parts of the document have changed “substantially” and it is still being finalised. It will be elaborated on by President Cyril Ramaphosa on Thursday evening, stated the report. The document states there is early evidence the full national lockdown imposed since 26 March 2020 has successfully limited the spread of the coronavirus. “However, there are serious risks associated with lifting lockdown restrictions too soon, or in an unsystematic and disorderly manner,” it said. It added that restrictions on economic activity need to be adapted to epidemiological trends and may need to be relaxed and tightened in different periods. “An alert system should be created with clearly defined levels of restriction that can be imposed by the National Command Council as necessary,” it said. The proposed alert system will have five levels, ranging from low virus spread (Level 1) to high virus spread (Level 5). At each level restrictions become more or less severe, and companies would know what activity is permitted depending on the level imposed. The government would be able to switch between levels and could use mass communications platforms (such as SMS) to signal this to the public. The level of alert will be determined by the National Command Council at each meeting, upon a recommendation from the Minister of Health and the Minister of Trade and Industry. A single national alert level may be determined, or an alert level may be determined for each province. An overview of the levels of restriction is given below. <img class="aligncenter wp-image-349069 size-large" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Levels-640x346.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="346" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Levels-640x346.jpg 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Levels-600x324.jpg 600w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Levels-768x415.jpg 768w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Levels.jpg 886w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> To determine which sectors should be allowed to resume activity, three criteria are proposed: Sectors that have a low risk of transmission, would suffer most acutely from a continued lockdown, and have a high value to the economy should be prioritised. The document added that sectors with a high risk of transmission should not be allowed to resume activity until this risk is reduced. The risk of transmission per industry is provided in the chart below. The table below provides an overview of the alert levels and the industries which are allowed to return to work.
