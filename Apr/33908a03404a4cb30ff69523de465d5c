Wootware has re-opened its online store and is able to deliver computer hardware in South Africa. “We’ve been issued an operating permit by government and will continue processing and dispatching orders during the shutdown period,” the Wootware website states. A redacted version of the permit from the Companies and Intellectual Property Commission is published on the Wootware website. Dawn Wing, one of Wootware’s courier partners, said it has confirmed that Wootware is an essential product provider. The courier company stated that it is therefore allowed to deliver Wootware’s products. Wootware founder and CEO Rory Magee told MyBroadband that they have taken precautions to ensure the safety of staff and customers, including the following: “Our existing courier partners, Dawn Wing and FedEx are processing our deliveries, each of whom has stringent procedures in place to ensure safe delivery,” Magee said.
