MyBroadband has launched its 2020 Working from Home Survey. The survey will only take 1 minute to complete, and your feedback will be used to provide valuable insight into the current business environment. By taking part in the survey you also stand a chance to win cool prizes. The prizes up for grabs are a 240GB SSD and an Amazon Echo Dot. To enter the prize draw, state “Done” in this forum thread after taking the survey. Please note that standard competition rules apply. The results of the survey will be used in a series of articles, detailing the feedback we received. With South Africa’s current lockdown in place, and further government restrictions possible, working from home is on the minds of many South Africans.
