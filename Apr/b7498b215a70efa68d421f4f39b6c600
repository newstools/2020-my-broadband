The South African government has published a new document which details what will be allowed to take place under each coronavirus alert level. When the full nationwide lockdown ends on 1 May 2020, South Africa will transition to a system of 5 alert levels. Level 5 is the most serious infection rate, while level 1 is the lowest infection rate. The country is currently at level 5, with the strictest lockdown restrictions. The national alert level will be lowered to level 4 from 1 May. This means that strict precautions will still hold, but more businesses will be allowed to operate in the country. The image below provides a summary of the alert levels. <img class="aligncenter wp-image-349303 size-large" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Levels-1-640x321.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="321" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Levels-1-640x321.jpg 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Levels-1-600x301.jpg 600w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Levels-1-768x385.jpg 768w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Levels-1.jpg 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> Following the launch of the the risk-adjusted strategy to open South Africa’s economy, which was launched for public comment and consultation today, the government has published a “Schedule of Services” document which details what activities will be allowed under each alert level. While level 5 and level 4 activities have been explained for both businesses and individuals, the document provides insight into what will be allowed under levels 3, 2, and 1. The document does state that it is subject to further revision, and therefore should not be seen as the final regulations. The full document is embedded below. Regulations will be released to further clarify the rules detailed in the document, according to statements from the government. These regulations will then be published to the public.
