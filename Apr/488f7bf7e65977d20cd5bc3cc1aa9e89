The DA has unveiled a new “sustainable and flexible” Smart Lockdown proposal for South Africa, aimed at protecting the economy while fighting the coronavirus. “Realistically, South Africa may have to contain the coronavirus right up until a vaccine is widely available in 18-24 months’ time,” said DA leader John Steenhuisen. Steenhuisen said considering its economic impact, the lockdown in its current form is not a feasible approach to contain the coronavirus in South Africa. “Regardless of when the lockdown ends, South Africa cannot immediately go back to business as usual,” he said. “We need a phased and flexible approach to ease the lockdown while ensuring that we contain the spread of the coronavirus.” Steenhuisen added that South Africa simply cannot afford a hard lockdown, as the economic repercussions will be disastrous. “South Africa does not have the fiscal space necessary to accommodate the severe assault a hard lockdown will unleash on our economy,” he said. This is why the DA has devised an alternative “Smart Lockdown” plan to supplement the government’s coronavirus response effort. The DA’s Smart Lockdown functions similarly to a load-shedding grid, or the different stages of water restrictions previously seen during the Western Cape drought. It provides four stages of lockdown relative to the national coronavirus infection rate for every sector of the South African economy and society. The DA said the plan can be amended in conjunction with stakeholders and government officials.
