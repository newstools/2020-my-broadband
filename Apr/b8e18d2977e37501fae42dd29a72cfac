The president said there would be a big increase in testing for the virus over the next few weeks in order to identify and isolate the infected. Communities across the country will be screened, he stated. He said this was necessary to contain the spread of the virus and avoid a massive loss of life in South Africa. Confirmed cases of the virus in South Africa have followed an unexpected trend in recent days, however, with a sharp decline in new cases per day since the start of the lockdown. This is unlike in countries such as the United States, Spain, and Italy, where there was a consistent increase in new cases until they reach a plateau. Mkhize said the government had initially expected between 4,000 and 5,000 cases by around 2 April.
