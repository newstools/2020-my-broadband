President Cyril Ramaphosa announced the national COVID-19 lockdown in South Africa will start to be eased next week. He said while the lockdown has been effective in containing the spread of the virus, it cannot be sustained indefinitely. When the full nationwide lockdown ends, South Africa will transition to a system of 5 alert levels to ensure we can ease restrictions as safely as possible. Level 5 is the most serious infection rate, while level 1 is the lowest infection rate. The country is currently at level 5, with the strictest lockdown restrictions. The national alert level will be lowered to level 4 from Friday, 1 May 2020. This means that strict precautions will still hold. Certain activity will be allowed to resume and certain businesses will be allowed to resume operations under a set of guidelines. Ramaphosa warned that some sectors will not be able to return to full production during level 4, while the risk of infection remains high. Businesses that are permitted to resume operations will also be required to do so in a phased manner. They will first need to prepare the workplace for a return to operations, followed by the return of employees in batches of no more than one-third. Every business will also have to adhere to detailed health and safety protocols to protect their employees, and will have to implement workplace plans to enable disease surveillance and prevent the spread of infection. When the country moves to level 4 after the lockdown ends on 1 May, the rules below will hold: Ramaphosa gave basic guidelines about the 5 alert levels: The image below provides an overview of the 5 levels. <img class="aligncenter wp-image-349303 size-large" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Levels-1-640x321.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="321" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Levels-1-640x321.jpg 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Levels-1-600x301.jpg 600w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Levels-1-768x385.jpg 768w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Levels-1.jpg 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> The alert system is designed to allow the government to react quickly and change the level of restrictions based on how the rate of coronavirus infections in our country is progressing.
