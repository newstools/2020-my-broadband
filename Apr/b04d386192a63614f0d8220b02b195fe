The government has launched its 5-level COVID-19 alert system, which provides details on which activities will be allowed under specific levels. South Africa is currently at level 5, which means that drastic measures are required to contain the spread of the virus to save lives. On Friday 1 May the country will move to level 4, which will allow some activities to resume, but under strict conditions. Minister of Cooperative Governance Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma highlighted that South Africa is still under lockdown, albeit with less stringent rules. People must therefore still remain at home and are not allowed to visit family and friends, or travel freely. All gatherings apart from funerals and work remain prohibited. This includes conferences, entertainments venues, cinemas, and theatres. Exercising will now be allowed under strict conditions, but gyms, running clubs, and sports clubs remain closed. It will also now be mandatory to wear a cloth mask when you leave your home, and strict social distancing and other rules must be adhered to at work. The government has provided a breakdown of the restrictions for each COVID-19 alert level. MyBroadband used this to create a simple guide regarding popular activities like exercise, going to restaurants, and flying. Here is a look at what is allowed at each level.
