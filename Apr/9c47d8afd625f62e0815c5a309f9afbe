This will, however, change soon. President Cyril Ramaphosa has announced the national COVID-19 lockdown in South Africa will start to be eased next week. He said while the lockdown has been effective in containing the spread of the virus, it cannot be sustained indefinitely. When the full nationwide lockdown ends, South Africa will transition to a system of five alert levels to ensure we can ease restrictions as safely as possible. Level 5 is the most serious infection rate, while level 1 is the lowest infection rate. The country is currently at level 5, with the strictest lockdown restrictions.
