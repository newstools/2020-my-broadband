Voice and contact centre diagnostics provider Illation has partnered with the service management specialist Virsae to bring unprecedented visibility to the company’s communication service offerings (currently Avaya, illation Voice on Demand and illation Contact Centre on Demand). Illation’s CEO, Gert Swart, stated that managing unified communications and call centre environments was becoming more complex, and specialist management systems were required to identify and remedy issues before they impacted customer experience. “Voice and contact centre systems are critical real-time applications and as such demand a level of management appropriate to the solution. However, until now it’s been difficult for businesses to adopt specialist UC management systems, because in most cases these systems require a host of on-site servers and software, which is costly and disruptive to the IT environment,” he said. Swart said that cloud-based Virsae Service Management offered businesses quick, non-disruptive access to specialist UC analytics. VSM delivers a range of functions geared for voice and contact centre environments, including UC resource utilisation and capacity balancing, risk mitigation, visibility of UC assets as well as platform performance and availability. Virsae Director for UK & EMEA, Ian McCarthy, said Virsae was committed to working with a select group of partners with a proven record in delivering managed services to complex environments. “It’s all about working with the right partners – not as many partners as possible, and Illation’s approach supports our vision for unified communications, contact centres and the way they should be managed.” This article was published in partnership with Illation.
