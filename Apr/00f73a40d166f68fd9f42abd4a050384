South African businesses which apply for financial assistance from the UIF’s Temporary Employer-Employee Scheme (TERS) are required to complete a 17-step process to ensure their Excel files are saved in the “correct format”. MyBroadband received feedback from local businesses which said the application process to the UIF was not a simple one, and many were told their applications could not be processed as the documents they submitted were incorrect. The TERS allows businesses who have been forced to partially or completely close due to the COVID-19 lockdown to apply for relief on behalf of their employees. The UIF will then assess the applications, and pay affected employees a percentage of their salaries. The successful processing of these applications has been very slow, however, according to a report by Moneyweb. On 16 April, the report stated the UIF had received 39,000 applications from businesses – and only processed 136. The UIF said this was due to a number of factors, including: The “correct CSV file format” has been a problem for businesses, though, based on feedback received by MyBroadband. To apply for assistance, companies are required to send a blank email to covid19ters@labour.gov.za. They then receive a response containing application instructions. An Excel file with columns for the company’s name, employee names and ID numbers, and other information is required to be completed and sent back to the UIF. This Excel file, said the UIF, must be saved as a CSV file that is pipe delimited. The process to achieve this format is not straightforward. In fact, the UIF provides companies with a 17-step process – downloadable as a PDF – on its website on how to achieve this. Saving a CSV file in a pipe delimited format requires more than selecting the right option in Microsoft Excel, and Windows users are required to change settings through their operating system’s Control Panel. The UIF’s supplied process on how to save the CSV is summarised below. The guide then goes on to list more instructions for users to follow as part of step 17, which is: “Verify the file by opening in Notepad and verify the following.” One business owner which spoke to MyBroadband said submitting a claim to the TERS was not smooth sailing. Firstly, the business owner worked on a MacBook, and there was no guide on how to save the CSV as pipe delimited in MacOS. After trying a method she found online via Google search, she mailed the requested files to the UIF. Several days went by with no response, after which she received a mail stating her application was not successful. She then mailed her company’s accountant for assistance, as they worked on a Windows PC. Following her accountant saving the document in the correct format, she submitted the new application to the UIF on 14 April. As of today, 19 April, she had not received any feedback. The UIF was asked for comment, but it did not respond to questions. <img class="aligncenter wp-image-348543" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Page-1-scaled.jpg" alt="UIF
