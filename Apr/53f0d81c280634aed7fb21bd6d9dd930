Checkers has announced that it will begin charging a delivery fee to customers who order groceries through its Sixty60 delivery app. In an email sent to customers on Thursday, Checkers said that from 4 May 2020, it will charge R35 per delivery to customers who order through the Sixty60 app. Previously, Checkers Sixty60 did not charge customers a delivery fee. “We’ll be introducing a delivery fee of R35 from Monday 4 May 2020 – making Checkers Sixty60 the cheapest and fastest grocery delivery service in South Africa,” the company said. “This delivery fee applies to all orders.” Checkers has continued to deliver essential products through its Sixty60 app throughout the lockdown period, offering customers the same price as in-store products. A comparison by MyBroadband found that the service was significantly cheaper for ordering groceries than Uber Eats, which charges a delivery fee of up to R15 per order depending on the distance of the store you are ordering from. Uber Eats and Mr D Food are expected to offer food deliveries from restaurants again after Friday 1 May, when the national COVID-19 alert level will be lowered to level 4. According to the new rules, however, food delivery will only be allowed between 09:00 and 20:00. It is important to note that unlike Uber Eats and Mr D Food, Checkers Sixty60 only offers grocery deliveries and users can only purchase products from Checkers stores. Additionally, stores can set their own prices in the Uber Eats app, while Checkers Sixty60 offers the same pricing as buying the products in-store. Checkers told MyBroadband that it had planned to introduce a delivery fee earlier this year. However, following the announcement of the National State of Disaster and subsequent lockdown, a decision was taken to continue to offer the service free of charge for the duration of the national lockdown. “It is par for the course that e-commerce services attract delivery fees,” Checkers said. “The introduction of our R35 delivery fee from next week is a natural progression of our business and remains to be the cheapest grocery delivery service in South Africa.” The company added that it has seen a marked increase in usage of its Sixty60 app following the initial announcement of the lockdown. “Since the National State of Disaster and subsequent lockdown was announced by President Cyril Ramaphosa, online shopping through the Group’s Sixty60 solutions has shown a significant surge in demand and we are making every effort to increase capacity and new areas for delivery,” Checkers said.
