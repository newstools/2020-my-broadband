The South African government has revealed new details about the easing of the lockdown in South Africa.

One of these economists is Mike Schussler, who recently discussed the impact of COVID-19 on the economy. Schussler said the economy was already in a dismal state prior to the coronavirus outbreak and subsequent lockdown. He said South Africa had big deficits, extreme unemployment and inequality, low growth, and uncertainty on land and property rights before the coronavirus crisis. With the country’s GDP expected to contract by over 6% this year, things are set to get much worse. Schussler predicts there can be anywhere between 1.3 million and 2 million jobs lost in South Africa because of the coronavirus crisis.
