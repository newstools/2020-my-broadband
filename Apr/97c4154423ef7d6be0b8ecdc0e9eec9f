South African schools are set to re-open during level 4 of the lockdown, which will be implemented on Friday 1 May and will relax a number of the restrictions implemented during the initial phase of the national lockdown. Minister of Basic Education Angie Motshekga announced today that the proposed date for Grade 7 and matric learners to return to school is 1 June 2020. Motshekga said that the proposed calendar was still under deliberation and that it would be gazetted when it was ready. “We are proposing that on 4 May, the sector opens,” said Motshekga. She stressed that neither learners nor teachers will need to return to school on this date. Instead, this date will apply to a limited group of department officials who will begin preparing for the reopening of schools. It is proposed that school management teams will return to work on 11 May to begin preparations for the school year to continue. While Grade 7 and matric learners may begin school on 1 June, other grades will be phased in gradually as the system becomes ready for them, Motshekga said.
