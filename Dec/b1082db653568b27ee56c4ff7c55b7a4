Minister for Cooperative Governance and Corporate Affairs Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma has published the updated alert level 1 lockdown regulations for South Africa. These regulations include new national restrictions on a number of activities, including alcohol sales, gatherings, and public spaces. This follows an address by President Cyril Ramaphosa on Monday 14 December 2020, during which he announced additional lockdown restrictions for the country ahead of the festive season. Ramaphosa also said the Sarah Baartman district in the Eastern Cape and the Garden Route District in the Western Cape are now classified as COVID-19 hotspots. This places them under more stringent regulations than the rest of the country, including a six-hour curfew from 22:00 until 04:00 and the closure of beaches and parks. These restrictions will be reviewed in early January based on the state of the pandemic across the country, Ramaphosa said. Below is the full list of additional restrictions which are now in force nationwide. The government gazette with the new lockdown rules is embedded below.
