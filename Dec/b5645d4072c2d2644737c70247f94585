“Within 48 hours, we had the R250 000 finance we needed.” – Mpho Masemola, M6T Finance Manager The devastation of the unexpected lockdown pandemic has significantly impacted the 250,000 small, medium and micro enterprises (SMMEs) that were estimated to be operating in the country before lockdown. Today, a sobering study by the Global Entrepreneurship Network reports that almost 55,000 of those SMMEs will not survive the year. But as business returns to normal now that lockdown restrictions are slowly being lifted, there is a glimmer of hope for the future of SMEs. “People have the perception that there’s no funding for small businesses, but VodaLend is there and has a simple process. Not only did they give us funding, they showed their human side during the COVID pandemic and offered us a three-month payment holiday because our revenue had decreased as a result of reduced volumes in international trade,” said Mpho Masemola the Finance Manager of M6T, a small business that successfully found the funding they required from VodaLend. Quintin Van Vuuren, Executive Head of Lending at Vodacom Financial Services, firmly believes that VodaLend can make a difference in the lives of many business owners, just as it did for M6T. He said, “We initially set out to disrupt the traditional financial services industry by providing funding to benefit SMEs. Being able to provide funding to businesses that need it has been deeply rewarding. VodaLend is committed to play integral role in bringing financial solutions to SMEs.” Get your business funded fast with VodaLend The VodaLend | Business Funding was perfectively positioned to step-in during the pandemic and assisted many businesses with their cash flow.
