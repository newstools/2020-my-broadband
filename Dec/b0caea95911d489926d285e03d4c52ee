With the festive season around the corner, South Africans will be headed to prime tourist destinations for a well-deserved break. For many, however, heading out the door will mean they also leave their uncapped fibre or ADSL package at home. This will force them to use expensive mobile prepaid or contract data to stay connected on their smartphones, laptops, and tablets. Fortunately, Axxess is offering the perfect solution. You can get a Huawei mobile Mi-Fi router at an incredible once-off price of R499 (a discount of R400) when you sign up for a month-to-month Telkom LTE package. This pocket-sized router is capable of download speeds of 54Mbps and can connect up to 16 devices at once – more than enough to keep the family online. Its battery can sustain continuous connectivity for six hours – or allow for standby time of 350 hours – ensuring you can stay online even while on the road. Using this router with a Telkom LTE SIM comes with a wide range of benefits. Unlike other large mobile data packages, it is not geo-locked to the closest network tower. This means you can use the service at more than one location, and with Telkom’s LTE network widely available across South Africa, you’ll find coverage almost everywhere. In addition, these packages are available on a month-to-month basis, so you can opt out at any time if you are unsatisfied with the service – without incurring a cancellation fee. The table below details the data allocations and prices of Telkom LTE packages available from Axxess. Whether you need to check emails and access your company’s cloud systems, or if the kids want to watch Netflix and YouTube, Axxess and Telkom LTE have you covered. These packages are also great for those who are staying at home but don’t have access to an uncapped fixed service. Click here to view the Telkom LTE packages available from Axxess.
