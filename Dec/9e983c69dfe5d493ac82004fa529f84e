2020 has been dominated by the coronavirus pandemic, which forced companies to rapidly digitize to support their employees working from home. The pandemic and subsequent lockdown crushed many industries like travel and tourism, restaurants, and entertainment. For the ICT industry the lockdown was both a blessing and a curse, depending on which services was offered and which clients they were serving. The demand for broadband access and video conferencing services spiked when the lockdown kicked in. Webcam and laptop sales also increased to support remote working and streaming services enjoyed great uptake with people stuck at home. IT companies which supported the travel, restaurant, entertainment, and retail industries, however, took a hit during the lockdown. The lockdown prevented many industries from operating which means they did not require IT or telecoms services. The biggest benefactors of the lockdown were data providers like Internet service providers (ISPs) and mobile operators. Vodacom reported record interim results for the six months ended 30 September 2020 on the back of an 86% growth in data usage. Rain said its sign-ups quadrupled after the lockdown kicked in which rapidly increased its subscriber base. Fibre ISPs like Cool Ideas and Afrihost also reported record growth on the back of increased broadband demand. While many companies just wanted to survive the year, others took the opportunity to gain market share and even launch new services. The biggest surprise was the launch of a new domestic airline Lift amidst a pandemic and travel restrictions. Lift was started by Kulula founder Gidon Novick who remains upbeat of the future of leisure travel despite the pandemic. Another big story was Alviva’s acquisition of Tarsus for R185 million to form an IT distribution powerhouse. There were also a few high-profile executive moves, like Rain CEO Willem Roos stepping down and Liquid Telecom CEO Reshaad Sha resigning. Here are the biggest South African IT and telecoms stories of the year. Alviva announced in November that it has entered into a share purchase agreement to acquire Tarsus for a maximum purchase consideration of R185,388,000. <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-340999" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Alviva-Pierre-Spies_headline.jpeg" alt="Alviva Pierre Spies_headline" width="640" height="430" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Alviva-Pierre-Spies_headline.jpeg 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Alviva-Pierre-Spies_headline-595x400.jpeg 595w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Alviva-Pierre-Spies_headline-300x202.jpeg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> Rain CEO Willem Roos will step down and move to a non-executive role from 1 March 2021.
