Minister of Cooperative Governance and Corporate Affairs Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma has published the updated alert level 1 lockdown regulations for South Africa. These regulations include new restrictions that will be imposed on specific areas identified as COVID-19 hotspots. This follows an address by President Cyril Ramaphosa on 3 December 2020, where he said that the first region to be classified as a hotspot is the Nelson Mandela Bay metropolitan municipality. “There is now clear evidence of a resurgence of infections in parts of our country, which if not confronted decisively and directly, could lead to great suffering and death.” “In line with our differentiated approach to the management of the pandemic, we will therefore implement additional measures in those areas identified as coronavirus hotspots,” he said. Ramaphosa also noted that there is a risk of COVID-19 resurgence in the Sarah Baartman district in the Eastern Cape and the Garden Route District in the Western Cape. Minister of Health Zweli Mkhize will be visiting these districts in the coming days to determine whether they will also be classified as hotspots. The national state of disaster has been extended to 15 January to enable the continued enforcement of lockdown regulations in South Africa. Existing COVID-19 alert level 1 restrictions will remain in place nationwide. In the event of a conflict in interpretation between existing level 1 lockdown restrictions and new hotspot restrictions, the latter will apply in respect of an area defined as a hotspot. Below is the full list of additional restrictions which will apply to COVID-19 hotspots.
