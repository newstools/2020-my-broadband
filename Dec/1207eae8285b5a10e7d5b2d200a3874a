Last year at Microsoft Ignite, Microsoft showcased an exciting new feature called Guest Join Access for Zoom and Webex on the Microsoft Teams Rooms (MTR) systems. Now, Kathea is thrilled to announce that Guest Join Access is finally ready and available! Here’s what you need to know: It is a simple as going into the device settings, selecting “Meetings”, and ticking “Zoom (Preview)” under Third Party Settings, as seen below: <img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-379976" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/IMAGE-2-640x360.png" alt="" width="640" height="360" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/IMAGE-2-640x360.png 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/IMAGE-2-600x338.png 600w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/IMAGE-2-768x432.png 768w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/IMAGE-2.png 816w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> When scheduling a meeting, your room will auto-accept any meeting request that you send. For Microsoft Teams, Webex and Zoom, you will get a click-to-join notification on your MTR touch screen. On your touchscreen, each meeting coming up will indicate what platform the meeting will be hosted on – by platform logo and colour. See examples below: <img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-379978" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/IMAGE-3-640x360.png" alt="" width="640" height="360" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/IMAGE-3-640x360.png 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/IMAGE-3-600x338.png 600w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/IMAGE-3-768x432.png 768w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/IMAGE-3.png 816w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> In this video, we showcase the new Guest Join Access feature for Zoom on the Microsoft Teams Room (MTR) system using our Yealink MVC300. <span data-mce-type="bookmark" style="display: inline-block; width: 0px; overflow: hidden; line-height: 0;" class="mce_SELRES_start">﻿</span> Focus & Small Meeting Rooms (< 7 Users) With easy-to-use devices including the UVC30 120° 4K camera, CP900 HD full duplex speakerphone, MTouch II, and MCore mini-PC, the Yealink MVC300 II video solution is a dedicated MTR system that meets the requirements of focus and small meeting rooms. <img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-379998" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Image-4-640x360.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="360" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Image-4-640x360.jpg 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Image-4-600x338.jpg 600w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Image-4-768x432.jpg 768w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Image-4.jpg 816w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> Focus & Small Meeting Rooms (< 7 Users) Getting started with Yealink UVC40, the all-in-one USB video bar offers a voice and video experience with an integrated AI-powered camera, microphone array and speaker.
