Many learners who have completed their matric exams are now planning to go to university to get qualified for the workplace. Although a university degree is not a guarantee to land a job or to make it to the top, it is a prerequisite for many positions. According to statistics from the United States’ Bureau of Labour, a Bachelor’s or Master’s degree is highly recommended to move up the corporate ladder. A further business administration qualification, like an MBA, is also a great way to complement your experience as a manager. All degrees are, however, not equal.
