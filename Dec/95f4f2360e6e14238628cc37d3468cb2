MyBroadband partnered with Pinnacle to promote the South African storage survey which will shed light on the local cloud and storage environment. The survey focuses on a few aspects of business storage solutions, including cloud storage and the most popular vendors. The survey will only take a minute to complete and you will stand a chance to win R5,000 cash. The winners of the survey will be announced next week after the survey closed.
