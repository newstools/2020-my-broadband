The Huawei MateBook range of laptops are powerful, stylish, and affordable – making them the perfect tech gift this festive season. Huawei’s new MateBook laptops are available in three models: the MateBook D 14, MateBook D 15, and MateBook X Pro. The D 14 and D 15 are exceptional mid-range devices for students and young professionals, while the MateBook X Pro offers a premium experience for those who need high-end performance. What the devices have in common, however, are the latest hardware, modern designs, and useful features made for all users. The MateBook range features compact and lightweight bodies, with the MateBook X Pro weighing just 1.33kg and measuring only 14.6mm thin. This thin-and-light design is further complemented by an immersive display with thin bezel, and the MateBook X Pro comes with a 3K display that delivers detail with 100% of the sRGB colour gamut covered. Furthermore, it supports touch capability for easy navigation. The MateBook D models then feature Full HD IPS panels with high brightness and vivid colour. Processing power for the MateBook X Pro comes from one of the fastest laptop processors on the market – the Intel Core i7-10510U. This is combined with an Nvidia MX250 GPU with 4GB video memory for high-end graphics power. The MateBook D laptops come equipped with either the AMD Ryzen 5 3500U or Ryzen 7 3700U chips, two highly-popular options for mid-tier laptops. The Ryzen 5 systems feature 8GB DDR4 RAM and a 256GB SSD, while the Ryzen 7 systems get 16GB RAM and a 512GB SSD. The full MateBook range is available from the Huawei Online Store. To provide even more value to users, Huawei is currently offering MateBook bundle deals which include a free backpack and mouse.
