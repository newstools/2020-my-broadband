2020 has been a highly disruptive year for business executives in South Africa with the COVID-19 pandemic and lockdown creating tremendous uncertainty. It is, therefore, no surprise that numerous high-profile chief executives have announced they are stepping down over the past eight months. Spur CEO Pierre van Tonder announced in July that he had resigned after working at the company for 38 years. He served as Spur CEO since 1996. One month later, the restaurant chain announced that its COO, Mark Farrelly, had resigned with effect from the end of August. The South African mining industry was also hit by two high-profile resignations earlier this year. AngloGold Ashanti CEO Kelvin Dushnisky announced he would step down for personal reasons on 1 September 2020. Gold Fields CEO Nick Holland announced he will be stepping down in 2021 after leading the company for 13 years. The local IT and telecommunications sector saw many resignations and moves since the lockdown was announced. These include MTN CEO Rob Shuter, Liquid Telecom SA CEO Reshaad Sha, Net1 CEO Herman Kotze, and Webafrica CEO Tim Wyatt-Gunning. Here are the biggest tech executives moves of 2020. In March, MTN announced that its group president and CEO Rob Shuter will be stepping down from his role at the end of his contract. In August, MTN said Ralph Mupita had been appointed as president and CEO of MTN Group effective from 1 September 2020, with incumbent CEO Rob Shuter stepping down on 31 August. <img class="size-full wp-image-169303 aligncenter" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Robert-Rob-Shuter-MTN-CEO.jpg" alt="Robert Rob Shuter MTN CEO" width="640" height="430" /> In June, Reshaad Sha announced that he had resigned as Liquid Telecom South Africa CEO to head up a new artificial intelligence venture.
