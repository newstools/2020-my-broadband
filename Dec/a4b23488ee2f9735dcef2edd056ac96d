2020 was defined by the COVID-19 pandemic and subsequent lockdowns, which forced people to change the way they work and live. Offices were closed, travel restrictions came into effect, and retail outlets were forced to change the way they operate. Fewer people visited restaurants, cinemas, and other entertainment venues. Instead, they stayed home watching Netflix and ordered food through Uber Eats. Many people cancelled their international travel plans and opted for local self-drive holidays. This changing environment had a direct impact on businesses across the world, with some benefitting while others were driven to bankruptcy. Thousands of restaurants across South Africa closed down because of lockdown restrictions that prevented them from operating. Hotels and airlines were also hard-hit, and they are still struggling to recover from the impact of travel restrictions. On the other end of the spectrum, telecommunications and IT providers struggled to cope with demand when the lockdown started. Sasfin Securities deputy chairman David Shapiro said the performance of six stocks defined the changes we saw over the past year. Here is a quick overview of these stocks and why they show how the world has changed in 2020. Moderna is an American biotechnology company which developed a COVID-19 vaccine which is in great demand across the world. <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-379526" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Moderna-share-price.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="260" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Moderna-share-price.jpg 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Moderna-share-price-600x244.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> Tesla is a global leader in electric cars, solar, and integrated renewable energy solutions for homes and businesses.
