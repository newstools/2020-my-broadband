WhatsApp continues to make changes to its app, ranging from design improvements to fully-fledged new features. We have listed a number of new features that could come to WhatsApp before the end of this year. It is important to note that none of these features and changes are confirmed to roll out this year, but they have been tested in the beta versions of the messaging platforms.

Notably, however, Facebook does not currently have properties that allow it access to the content of chats, members of a specific group, and profile pictures of contacts.

Once it is enabled, the Linked Devices menu will be available from the overflow menu in the app’s home screen. Users will need to connect to a Wi-Fi connection when logging into a new device so that their chat history and relevant media can be backed up and synced. A number of new WhatsApp features have been tested on Apple’s iOS operating system. These features include the following:
