Named the iCE3 Autotrader, this managed trading bot is configurable to each user’s personal trading parameters. It is easy to get started with the service, and to set up and configure your own trading bots on the exchange. Traders who use high-frequency trading bots typically use the following strategies, which are all supported by the Autotrader bot: A market making trading bot, for example, will automatically post limit buy and sell orders and wait for other participants to fill the orders. Using iCE3’s trading bot functionality, you can set up this service and configure everything from how far away from the mid-price the buy and sell orders are, the order quantities, and the update rates. Configuration options for iCE3’s trading bot include: The service offers cross-exchange market making through API connections to iCE3, Binance, Kraken, and Bittrex. Users can also set up the automatic trading bot to conduct arbitrage trading between these exchanges, as well as algorithmic trading. The iCE3 trading bot will be rolled out and made available to AIC token holders in October 2020. Users can also sign up for the iCE3 Autotrader beta on the exchange’s website.
