Both models are powered by the highly-popular AMD Ryzen 5 3500U processor, which boasts four cores and eight threads, with a maximum clock speed of 3.8GHz. This comes paired with 8GB of DDR4 RAM, and a super-fast 256GB NVMe PCIe SSD. For graphical prowess, users get a Radeon Vega 8 integrated GPU, which provides solid performance for light gaming and support for 4K external output. <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-362764" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Huawei-Matepad-D_AMD-chip.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="430" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Huawei-Matepad-D_AMD-chip.jpg 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Huawei-Matepad-D_AMD-chip-595x400.jpg 595w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Huawei-Matepad-D_AMD-chip-300x202.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> Huawei is well-reputed for making smartphones, smartwatches, and tablets which offer superior battery endurance to their rivals. This is no different for its laptops, with the MateBook D 14’s 56Wh battery capable of powering the system for up to 14 hours while connected to Wi-Fi. The MateBook D 15 comes with an efficient 42Wh battery pack, which puts out 8 hours in the same circumstances. Charging the laptop while on the go is simple, with the compact 65W charging adapter and USB-C cable small enough to carry in your pocket. With fast charging capabilities, you’ll be able to take the battery on either laptop from 0% to 50% in around 30 minutes. <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-362778" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Huawei-Matepad-D-charger.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="430" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Huawei-Matepad-D-charger.jpg 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Huawei-Matepad-D-charger-595x400.jpg 595w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Huawei-Matepad-D-charger-300x202.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> In our digital era where data protection is of great importance, MateBook D owners will benefit from enhanced security features. To start with, the power button sports a built-in fingerprint reader for easy and secure biometric unlocking and log in. The MateBook D’s webcam is also well protected, and features an innovative recessed design which sees the camera built into the keyboard. A single press pops the camera up when you need it, and after you’re done, you can just flip it down again to prevent any potential remote access or security breaches. <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-362774" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Huawei-MatePad-D_fingerprint-reader.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="430" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Huawei-MatePad-D_fingerprint-reader.jpg 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Huawei-MatePad-D_fingerprint-reader-595x400.jpg 595w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Huawei-MatePad-D_fingerprint-reader-300x202.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> The MateBook D 14 and D 15 are available from R13,499 on the Huawei Online Store.
