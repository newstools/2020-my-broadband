5G has arrived in South Africa, with Vodacom, MTN, and Rain all launching their 5G networks in the country in the past year. Their network coverage is limited, however. Rain’s 5G service currently exists as a fixed 5G offering only, with customers able to purchase uncapped home 5G broadband in coverage areas in Johannesburg and Cape Town. MTN and Vodacom offer mobile 5G connectivity, which means that if you have a 5G mobile phone you will be able to take advantage of the technology’s improved speeds and latency in coverage areas. It is important to note that the coverage of MTN and Vodacom’s 5G networks is currently limited to selected urban areas, and it will take a significant amount of time for these networks to expand across the country. Vodacom has enabled 5G support on its network via its roaming agreement with Liquid Telecom, while MTN has used temporary spectrum allocated by ICASA for the COVID-19 lockdown to launch its 5G network. MTN is hopeful that additional spectrum will be allocated by ICASA before its temporary spectrum is revoked, allowing it to continue rolling out 5G without interruption. Shortly after the initial launch of these 5G networks, South Africa began to see the first 5G smartphones arrive locally. The first 5G smartphones to launch in South Africa were the Huawei P40 and Huawei P40 Pro – the latest flagship smartphones in the Huawei P Series. These were followed by the LG Velvet 5G and the Huawei P40 Lite 5G, which both offer more affordable 5G connectivity options. Most recently, Samsung launched its Galaxy Note 20 and Note 20 Ultra smartphones in South Africa. These ultra-high-end smartphones boast the latest camera technology and hardware, and ship in LTE and 5G models. The 5G models of these Galaxy Note 20 and Note 20 Ultra devices are available to purchase in South Africa. We have listed every 5G smartphone available in South Africa below, along with their specifications and pricing. <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-363640"
