The Pixel 4a sports the same great primary camera system as the previous-generation Google smartphones, as well as a redesigned punch-hole display layout for an improved screen-to-body ratio. In addition to the Pixel 4a, Google also confirmed the launch of its upcoming Pixel 5 and a 5G version of the Pixel 4a. “This year, Pixel 4a – which launches this month – and the first 5G-enabled Pixels, Pixel 4a (5G) and Pixel 5 coming this fall, will continue to bring the features people love – like an incredible camera and feature drops that make your phone better over time – packaged in sleek new hardware at more affordable prices,” Google said. The Pixel 4a is built to offer users everything they love about Google hardware, and the company said its new device offers longer battery life, professional-looking photos, enterprise-grade security, and an affordable price tag. Google emphasised the performance of the smartphone’s camera in its launch announcement, highlighting the following features: Other new features include improved Google Assistant integration, a pre-loaded Personal Safety app, and Live Caption, which provides real-time captioning for video and audio content, as well as calls. Google’s Pixel 4 sports an impressive 5.81-inch Full HD+ OLED display with a small punch-hole cutout that houses the 8MP front-facing camera. The smartphone is powered by the Qualcomm Snapdragon 730 chipset paired with 6GB of RAM and 128GB of internal storage.
