Huawei’s latest high-performance professional notebook – the Huawei MateBook D 15 – has launched in South Africa. The MateBook D 15 is a slim notebook that is aimed at professionals, offering exceptional power and portability for its price range. The laptop is impressively thin and light – its chassis is only 16.9mm thick and it weighs in at 1.62kg. This is despite the impressive hardware inside, which includes a quad-core AMD Ryzen 5 CPU and Radeon Vega 8 graphics. The MateBook D 15 also sports a 256GB SSD for high-speed storage and 8GB of DDR4 RAM. Its ultra-slim metallic body is light and durable, and it is well-equipped when it comes to connectivity. The MateBook D 15’s ports include HDMI, Ethernet, and USB Type-C connections, as well as three USB Type-A ports and a standard 3.5mm audio jack. The laptop’s USB-C charger design is excellent, as you can also use it to charge your smartphone – provided your smartphone uses a USB-C port. Furthermore, the MateBook D 15 supports fast charging. This allows its battery to be recharged from empty up to 50% in just 30 minutes. The laptop’s battery will then last up to 14 hours when connected to Wi-Fi, making it ideal for professionals on the go or for working when power is unavailable. Other great features of the Huawei MateBook D 15 include a key on the laptop’s keyboard that pops up to function as a webcam, as well as a fingerprint sensor for security. The laptop has a bezel-less 15.6-inch display with an impressive screen-to-body ratio, delivering the aesthetic and performance of a high-end notebook at an attractive price.
