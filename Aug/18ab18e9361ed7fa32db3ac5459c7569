Numerous high-profile chief executives have announced they are stepping down over the past five months, including a few well-known tech and telecoms CEOs. The COVID-19 pandemic and subsequent lockdown have put tremendous pressure on companies, with tough trading conditions and dwindling revenues. Many industries were prevented from operating or were only allowed limited operations, during alert level 4 and 5 of the lockdown. In an attempt to stave off retrenchment, many companies introduced salary cuts and short time, but in some cases, it was not enough. The tough trading conditions, combined with political and economic uncertainty, took their toll on executives. Since the lockdown started in March, many South African CEOs have announced their resignations. While many of the resignations are directly linked to the lockdown, others most likely considered it previously and saw the lockdown as an opportune time to step down. Here is a list of prominent chief executives who have announced their resignations in recent months. Webafrica CEO Tim Wyatt-Gunning stepped down on 1 July 2020 and was replaced by Sean Nourse, who has served as MWEB CEO for the past three years. Wyatt-Gunning has been Webafrica CEO since October 2011, and said it was the right time to find a successor with fresh ideas. <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-355327" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Tim-Wyatt-Gunning.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="430" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Tim-Wyatt-Gunning.jpg 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Tim-Wyatt-Gunning-595x400.jpg 595w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Tim-Wyatt-Gunning-300x202.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> In June, Reshaad Sha announced that he had resigned as Liquid Telecom South Africa CEO to head up a new artificial intelligence venture.
