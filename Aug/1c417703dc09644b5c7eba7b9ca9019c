President Cyril Ramaphosa has announced that South Africa will move from alert level 3 to alert level 2 on Monday, which will see many lockdown rules relaxed. Ramaphosa said the country’s infection rate has declined in recent weeks which resulted in a relaxation of the lockdown restrictions. “Over the last three weeks, the number of new confirmed cases has dropped from a peak of over 12,000 a day to an average, over the past week, of around 5,000 a day,” he said. “The recovery rate from coronavirus has risen from 48% at the time of my last address and now stands at 80%.” He said all indications are that South Africa has reached the peak and moved beyond the inflection point of the curve. Now, amid the signs of hope, he said the country is ready to enter a new phase in its response to the pandemic. South Africa will move to alert level 2, with effect from midnight on Monday, 17 August 2020. The move to level 2 will remove nearly all of the restrictions on the resumption of economic activity across most industries. These include: A few of the current lockdown restrictions will remain in place to guard against a second wave hitting the country. The table below provides an overview of the biggest changes when the country moves from level 3 to level 2. <img class="aligncenter wp-image-364002" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Lockdown-Level-2.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="866" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Lockdown-Level-2.jpg 1280w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Lockdown-Level-2-296x400.jpg 296w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Lockdown-Level-2-318x430.jpg 318w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Lockdown-Level-2-768x1039.jpg 768w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Lockdown-Level-2-1136x1536.jpg 1136w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Lockdown-Level-2-1200x1623.jpg 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" />
