Microsoft has announced a new feature on the Your Phone app that allows users to access their phone’s mobile apps directly from their Windows 10 PC. “When you launch an app, it opens in a separate window outside of the Your Phone app enabling you to multitask,” said Microsoft. These apps do not need to be installed, nor do you need to sign into them on your PC. Instead, if your phone is connected to the Your Phone app, these applications will run natively on your PC as Windows applications. Key features available through this new feature include: To use this app, you must fulfil the following requirements: Limitations include some apps blocking the ability to cast to other screens – resulting in a black screen – games not responding to mouse and/or keyboard input, and audio from apps playing from your smartphone. The ability to run multiple apps simultaneously is also not yet available and will be introduced later in 2020. The feature is available through the Your Phones app and can be accessed on a variety of Samsung smartphones. <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-362912" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Your-Phone.jpg" alt="Your Phone" width="640" height="431" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Your-Phone.jpg 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Your-Phone-594x400.jpg 594w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Your-Phone-300x202.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" />
