MyBroadband has partnered with BCX and HPE to learn more about SAP in South Africa through an online survey. Particularly, when is your business planning on moving to SAP S/4 HANA? The migration of an existing SAP Business Suite to the cloud-based SAP S/4HANA platform – SAP’s fourth ERP business suite – allows companies to benefit from next-generation operations on a proven technology platform that will underpin business growth. By taking part in the SAP survey, you will provide valuable feedback on what local companies plan to do about potential migrations. You also stand a chance to win a R3,000 prize by completing the survey and filling in your details.
