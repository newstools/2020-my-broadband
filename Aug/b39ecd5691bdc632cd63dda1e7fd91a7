Smartphones get more powerful every year, enabling a wealth of new functionality and granting power users even more utility. A powerful smartphone comes with greater capability almost all operations, from high-quality photo and video capture capabilities to gaming and multi-tasking. The world’s three biggest smartphone manufacturers – Apple, Huawei, and Samsung – all offer impressive handsets which rank among the most powerful in the world. Competition is especially fierce considering that each manufacturer implements their own chipsets in their flagship smartphones. Despite this, they offer relatively similar performance based on benchmarks which rank overall capabilities. Using benchmark data from AnTuTu, we ranked the overall performance of the current-generation smartphones which are available to purchase in South Africa. AnTuTu is a popular benchmarking application that measures the following variables: The results of these benchmarks are then combined to provide a total benchmark score, which we used to rank the overall performance of both Android and iOS smartphones. Devices which were unavailable in South Africa at the time of writing were excluded from the comparison. The Samsung Galaxy Note 20 and Note 20 Ultra are also not included in this comparison as there is currently no benchmark data available for these smartphones. As they use the same Exynos 990 chipset as the Galaxy S20 series, however, they should deliver similar performance. Each of the top 10 smartphones available to purchase in South Africa is listed below. <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-319595" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/iPhone-11-Pro-4.jpg" alt="iPhone 11 Pro 4" width="640" height="430" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/iPhone-11-Pro-4.jpg 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/iPhone-11-Pro-4-300x202.jpg 300w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/iPhone-11-Pro-4-595x400.jpg 595w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" />   <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-319595" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/iPhone-11-Pro-4.jpg" alt="iPhone 11 Pro 4" width="640" height="430" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/iPhone-11-Pro-4.jpg 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/iPhone-11-Pro-4-300x202.jpg 300w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/iPhone-11-Pro-4-595x400.jpg 595w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-338384" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Galaxy-S20.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="430" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Galaxy-S20.jpg 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Galaxy-S20-595x400.jpg 595w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Galaxy-S20-300x202.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-364890" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/OnePlus-7t-Pro.jpg" alt="OnePlus 7t Pro" width="640" height="430" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/OnePlus-7t-Pro.jpg 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/OnePlus-7t-Pro-595x400.jpg 595w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/OnePlus-7t-Pro-300x202.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-364888" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Apple-iPhone-11.jpg" alt="Apple iPhone 11" width="640" height="430" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Apple-iPhone-11.jpg 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Apple-iPhone-11-595x400.jpg 595w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Apple-iPhone-11-300x202.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-355481" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Huawei-P40-Pro.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="430" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Huawei-P40-Pro.jpg 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Huawei-P40-Pro-595x400.jpg 595w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Huawei-P40-Pro-300x202.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-331830" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Note-10-Plus-1.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="430" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Note-10-Plus-1.jpg 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Note-10-Plus-1-595x400.jpg 595w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Note-10-Plus-1-300x202.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-349469" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/iPhone-SE-2020.jpg" alt="iPhone SE 2020" width="640" height="430" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/iPhone-SE-2020.jpg 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/iPhone-SE-2020-595x400.jpg 595w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/iPhone-SE-2020-300x202.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" />
