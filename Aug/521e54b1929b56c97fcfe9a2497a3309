Apple accounted for one in every two smartwatches sold around the world in the first half of 2020. This is according to the latest smartwatch shipment report from Counterpoint, which showed that 42 million smartwatches were sold during the period. Senior researcher Sujeong Lim said smartwatches remained a popular consumer device segment, compared to the downturn seen in smartphone demand and many other segments due to COVID-19. “India (+57% YoY), Europe (+9% YoY) and the US (+5% YoY), the most affected regions of COVID-19, saw a healthy growth in smartwatch shipments which offset the decline in other markets,” Lim noted. Apple increased its share of shipments from 43.2% to 51.4%. “Apple captured a record half of the market in terms of revenue due to strong demand for the Apple Watch S5 models,” Lim stated. “In terms of shipment volumes, Apple Watch grew 22% globally with Europe and North America being the fastest growing markets in the first half of 2020,” Lim added. It was followed by Garmin and Huawei, which claimed 9.4% and 8.3% of shipments, respectively. Samsung, meanwhile, dropped from second place in H1 2019 with 9.3% of sales to fourth with 7.2% of the market.
