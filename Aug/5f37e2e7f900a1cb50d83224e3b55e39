Blue Label Telecom has provided an update on Cell C’s turnaround strategy, which revealed that Cell C has lost nearly a third of its subscribers between June 2019 and May 2020. While this big reduction in subscribers may concern some investors, Blue Label Telecom highlighted that it did not have a significant impact on service revenue. Cell C’s service revenue only declined by 2% during the reporting period – down from R14.247 billion to R13.901 billion. Blue Label Telecom explained the loss in subscribers has resulted in an increase in the quality of its subscribers. It said Cell C was not wasting commercial expenses to acquire customers that are not providing a return. Cell C explained it has been actively managing its customer base by pursuing more profitable customers. “This has resulted in a reduction in the Cell C customer base. With a decline on 28% of the base, we have maintained and grown revenue based on the trend,” it said. Cell C has also removed non-profitable products and increased its focus on retail product pricing. This helped to increase Cell C’s EBITDA by 10% from R3.391 billion to R3.744 billion. The chart below shows Cell C’s service revenue versus total subscribers over the last year. <img class="aligncenter wp-image-365190 size-full" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Service-Revenue-vs-Total-Subscribers_Cell-C.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="430" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Service-Revenue-vs-Total-Subscribers_Cell-C.jpg 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Service-Revenue-vs-Total-Subscribers_Cell-C-595x400.jpg 595w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Service-Revenue-vs-Total-Subscribers_Cell-C-300x202.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> Blue Label Telecom’s management said it remains upbeat about Cell C’s prospects and is of the opinion that Cell C will continue as a going concern for the foreseeable future.
