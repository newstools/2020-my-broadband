The North West Provincial Legislature’ Standing Committee on Provincial Public Accounts (SCOPA) wants answers from the Madibeng Local Municipality about irregular expenditure. Success Marota, an executive at the Auditor-General’s North West branch, said the municipality acquired the fourth consecutive disclaimer audit opinion due to lack of sufficient appropriate audit evidence. Marota said there are no consequences for financial misconduct and transgressions in the municipality despite sufficient evidence of wrongdoing. Some of the problems highlighted by Marota following virtual Municipal Finance Management Act public hearings include: The Provincial Public Accounts Chairperson, Job Dliso, said Madibeng Municipality should submit a detailed report on the payments of DSTV and clothing accounts paid from the municipal bank account. The names of officials implicated in the DSTV and clothing accounts must be listed and the municipality must state what actions have been taken against them. “We cannot allow public money to be used for personal interests,” Dliso said.
