Nu Metro has announced that it will reopen most of its flagship cinema complexes on Friday 28 August 2020. The following cinema complexes will be reopening: The six remaining Nu Metro cineplexes will reopen in the near future, Nu Metro said, but must remain temporarily closed as part of Nu Metro’s “responsible reopening strategy”. “Nu Metro is very excited to go big again with the magic of the movies,” said Nu Metro marketing and content executive Chantelle Burrows. “Nu Metro has been anxiously anticipating this moment to reopen our doors to movie fans once again, as part of a coordinated industry effort to restart this business we love to call showbiz.” Nu Metro said that it will initially only be opening its cinemas to the public on Fridays to Sundays, as well as on public holidays. Daily showtimes will be limited, and some movies will be screened over several screens with staggered time slots per complex. It also noted that the scheduling of its films will ensure adherence to the 22:00 national curfew, and will include measures to support social distancing. Nu Metro confirmed that alongside its standard 2D and 3D cinemas, most of its “premium cinema experiences” will also reopen on a limited basis in select complexes. These include multi-sensory 4DX, “Premium Large Format” Xtreme, and luxurious VIP theatres. Nu Metro’s VIP theatres will include bar- and sit-down restaurant services that implement the necessary social distancing and other preventative measures. In-cinema dining ordered from Nu Metro’s VIP menu will also be served according to the health and safety regulations. Nu Metro detailed some of the key health and safety protocols it will be implementing in its cinemas: Nu Metro said that Christopher Nolan’s Tenet movie will be the first major film scheduled for its cinemas’ reopening. A selection of recent box office hits and other audience favourites will also be screened during the first phase of its reopening. “This scheduling strategy is due to the limited availability of new filmed content for cinemas worldwide, caused by the postponement of films’ release dates globally following the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic,” explained Nu Metro. <img class="aligncenter wp-image-364718" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/nu-metro-COVID-19-protocols-430x430.jpg" alt="nu metro COVID 19 protocols" width="640" height="640" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/nu-metro-COVID-19-protocols-430x430.jpg 430w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/nu-metro-COVID-19-protocols-400x400.jpg 400w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/nu-metro-COVID-19-protocols-768x768.jpg 768w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/nu-metro-COVID-19-protocols.jpg 960w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" />
