Openserve is increasing the speed of three of its fibre products – 10Mbps, 20Mbps, and 50Mbps – at no cost to consumers. The company said it continuously monitors client and market demands to provide consumers with world-class broadband services. “In support of this drive, we’ve announced additional enhancements to our existing Openserve Fibre Connect offering, effective 01 August 2020,” it said. The Openserve Fibre Connect speed upgrades comprise the following changes: These speed changes bring Openserve in line with other fibre operators like Vumatel, Octotel, and Frogfoot. To see how Openserve’s new products and pricing compare with other fibre operators, MyBroadband used Afrihost’s uncapped Pure Fibre prices. This comparison shows that Openserve’s uncapped fibre pricing is lower than its main competitors – Vumatel, Octotel, and Frogfoot.
