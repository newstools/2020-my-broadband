Images alleged to be press renders of the Samsung Galaxy S20 Ultra 5G have surfaced online. The images, which were provided by leaker Ishan Agarwal and 91Mobiles, provide insight into the design of this smartphone’s camera. If these renders are legitimate, the Galaxy S20 Ultra will have a square bump containing three lenses and a flash, as well as a rectangular bump underneath the square one containing what is believed to be a “periscope lens.” According to TechRadar, this periscope lens could include 5x optical zoom, 30x “lossless” zoom, and a 100x “space zoom” feature. The other lenses on the S20 Ultra 5G are expected to comprise a 108MP primary lens, a 12MP ultrawide lens, and a time-of-flight sensor. The leaks also imply that the 3D curved edges that S-series phones typically sport have been toned down. The Ultra 5G will come in two colours, said the leakers – Cosmic Grey and Cosmic Black. There is other information in the leak that was already widely rumoured, including a 6.9-inch display with a 120Hz refresh rate and a central punch-hole for the front camera. 91Mobiles claims that the Galaxy S20 Ultra 5G’s pricing will begin at €1,349 (R21,428).
