Samsung has announced that its 8K QLED TVs will be among the first sets to be officially certified by the 8K Association (8KA). The cross-industry group was created to facilitate the growth of the 8K ecosystem and listed its performance specifications for the 8K standard in September 2019. Samsung has now detailed a partnership with 8KA to have its new 8K TVs certified. Going by the Association’s requirements, this means that Samsung’s certified 8K TVs will boast a resolution of at least 7,680 x 4,320 pixels, with a peak brightness of 600 nits, and support for HDMI 2.1 and HEVC (H.265 codec) standards. Samsung’s Executive Vice President of the Visual Displays Business, Hyogun Lee, said the certification will help inform buyers. “Our goal is to provide consumers with the ability to easily identify premium 8K displays from other devices when making purchasing decisions,” Lee stated. The announcement comes after claims from rival LG in 2019 that Samsung’s TVs were not true 8K. LG said the pixel count itself should not be the final measure for resolution, but that the ability to distinguish between adjacent pixels should be a key factor. It maintained that its OLED panels allowed for superior distinguishability between pixels, while Samsung’s QLED technology was lacking.
