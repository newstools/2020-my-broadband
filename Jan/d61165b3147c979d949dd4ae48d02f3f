South Africa’s official 2019 matric pass rate of 81.3% does not tell the full story, as it ignores the large percentage of students who drop out along the way. As a result, methods have been proposed to measure the “true” matric pass rate of South Africa. One way is to compare the matric pass rate to the number of children who entered grade 1 in 2008. This gives a pass rate of 37.6% when taking into account all the students who dropped out over time. Equal Education has said that it measures the pass rate by looking at how many grade 2 students eventually passed matric. The number of children who repeat grade 1 tends to be higher than for grade 2, the organisation said. The DA prefers to compare the number of matrics who passed to students who enter the FET band in grade 10. You may elect to leave school after grade 9 in South Africa. All these calculations produce a pass mark well below the official 81.3% figure released by the Department of Basic Education. Another concerning measure is the number of students who pass matric compared to those who enrol for grade 12. The official pass rate is calculated by dividing the number of passes by the number of matrics who wrote exams. However, a huge gap has started to develop in the number of students who enrol for matric compared to those who sit the exams. To see how the DA and Equal Education’s measures compare, we plotted them against one another and the official pass rate. We also showed a recalculated pass rate for all students who enrolled for matric. The graphs below are drawn from data provided in the annual Education Statistics in South Africa reports prepared by the Department of Basic Education, along with its yearly NSC Examinations Technical reports. The graph below shows how the grade 2 and grade 10 cohort pass rates compare to the official pass rate from 2010 to 2019. It also shows the pass rate of all grade 12 learners who registered to take the matric finals, and not only those who wrote the exams. <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-334412" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Matric-cohort-pass-rates-2010-2019.jpg" alt="Graph of Matric cohort pass rates 2010-2019" width="640" height="416" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Matric-cohort-pass-rates-2010-2019.jpg 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Matric-cohort-pass-rates-2010-2019-600x390.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> The graph below shows how the official pass rates, including degree and diploma passes, have changed since 2010. <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-334410" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Matric-official-pass-rates-2010-2019.jpg" alt="Graph of official matric pass rates 2010-2019" width="640" height="416" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Matric-official-pass-rates-2010-2019.jpg 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Matric-official-pass-rates-2010-2019-600x390.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" />
