Panasonic unveiled new compact prototype virtual reality (VR) glasses at CES 2020. The company said this is the world’s first VR headset that is High Dynamic Range (HDR) capable and boasts ultra-high-definition (UHD) picture quality. Most conventional high-performance VR headsets are bulky and normally require the user to have the device strapped around their head. Panasonic’s device possesses a far smaller form-factor than the competition and is designed to fit as comfortably as normal eyeglasses. The company worked with Kopin Corporation to equip the eyeglasses with a micro OLED panel capable of delivering a 3,840 x 2,160 resolution without introducing the “screen door effect” For sound, Panasonic employed its own Technics audio technology, which the company said produces “high-quality sound capable of the reproduction over a wide range of frequencies from ultra-low to high.” The planned final product will use a single USB-C cable that runs out of the end of one of its bands to connect to a PC, console, or other VR capable system. The Verge noted that this iteration of the eyeglasses is not likely to be commercially available. Panasonic said it created the glasses to show the technology’s potential ahead of the new services that may be coming with the continued rollout of 5G, including VR sports viewing and virtual travel experiences. <img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-334802" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Panasonic-VR-glasses_4-640x430.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="430" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Panasonic-VR-glasses_4.jpeg 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Panasonic-VR-glasses_4-595x400.jpeg 595w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Panasonic-VR-glasses_4-300x202.jpeg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> <img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-334808" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Panasonic-VR-glasses_6-640x430.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="430" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Panasonic-VR-glasses_6.jpeg 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Panasonic-VR-glasses_6-595x400.jpeg 595w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Panasonic-VR-glasses_6-300x202.jpeg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" />
