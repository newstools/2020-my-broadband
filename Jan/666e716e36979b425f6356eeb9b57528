The driver who recorded themselves hitting 309km/h on the N1 in Gauteng has been arrested, according to a report by News24. The report stated that the Road Traffic Management Corporation (RTMC) confirmed the arrest, adding that the man was arrested while attending a funeral in Limpopo. The driver was described as a 36-year-old man who is now being held at the Midrand police station. He is set to appear in court soon. News of the speedster first broke on 20 January when a video of him hitting 309km/h in what is believed to be an Audi TT RS was shared on social media. Social media comments regarding the speedster were mixed, with people slating it as irresponsible and criminal – while others defended the driver’s actions. Several days later, on 23 January, the RTMC said the driver had been identified by traffic authorities. The RTMC said the driver “must come forward and present himself or we will visit him at his place of residence in Midrand”. Many commentators said the authorities were bluffing with the aim of getting the driver – who they argued was unknown to them – to hand himself over. They also questioned how they would provide who was driving the vehicle at the time of the incident, as the video only shows the car’s dashboard.
