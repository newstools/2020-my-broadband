ASUS and Nvidia yesterday revealed the world’s fastest gaming monitor, which will be showcased at CES 2020. The companies have collaborated to announce the ASUS ROG Swift 360, which features a 360Hz refresh rate and G-Sync support. The ROG Swift 360 boasts a 24.5-inch panel with a maximum resolution of 1,920 x 1,080. Nvidia said that the monitor processes frames at a much higher rate than typical displays. “At 360Hz, game frames are displayed once every 2.8ms – up to 6-times faster than traditional gaming displays and TVs.” Gaming monitors with 144Hz and 240Hz refresh rates have become popular among gamers that play games which require lightning-fast responses, such as competitive shooters. ASUS claimed that these rates still need to be further improved. “Our recent testing of games like Counter-Strike: Global Offensive and Overwatch proved that not even 240Hz monitors are fast enough to display every frame on offer from those titles using the latest and greatest hardware,” ASUS said. “Even compared to widely-available 240Hz gaming monitors, the ROG Swift 360Hz can draw a whopping 50% more frames every second. With this kind of benefit, it’s only a matter of time before every competitive player will want nothing less than the new best of 360Hz.” The company is not new to pushing the envelope of high refresh-rate display technology – it previously revealed the world’s first 300Hz gaming laptop in 2019. No official release date has been announced for the ASUS ROG Swift 360, but ASUS said it will be available “later this year”. <img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-334064" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Screenshot-2020-01-06-at-07.16.24-640x381.png" alt="" width="640" height="381" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Screenshot-2020-01-06-at-07.16.24-640x381.png 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Screenshot-2020-01-06-at-07.16.24-600x357.png 600w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Screenshot-2020-01-06-at-07.16.24-768x457.png 768w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Screenshot-2020-01-06-at-07.16.24-1536x913.png 1536w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Screenshot-2020-01-06-at-07.16.24-2048x1218.png 2048w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Screenshot-2020-01-06-at-07.16.24-1200x714.png 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> <img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-334066" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Screenshot-2020-01-06-at-07.16.50-640x430.png" alt="" width="640" height="430" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Screenshot-2020-01-06-at-07.16.50-640x430.png 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Screenshot-2020-01-06-at-07.16.50-594x400.png 594w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Screenshot-2020-01-06-at-07.16.50-300x202.png 300w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Screenshot-2020-01-06-at-07.16.50-768x517.png 768w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Screenshot-2020-01-06-at-07.16.50.png 1102w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" />
