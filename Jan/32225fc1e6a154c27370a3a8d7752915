Stage 2 load-shedding will continue throughout the weekend, but City Power customers in Johannesburg will be unaffected. Eskom said earlier today that stage 2 load-shedding would be implemented from 09:00 on Friday until 06:00 on Monday 2 February. However, City Power announced on Twitter that its Johannesburg customers would be unaffected by load-shedding as it has extra capacity available. “Eskom has announced that Stage 2 load-shedding will continue throughout the weekend until Monday,” City Power said. “City Power customers will not be load-shed due to the extra capacity available.” City Power said that while it receives around 90% of its power from Eskom, it has 10% coming from Kelvin Power Station east of Johannesburg. “The extra capacity City Power has comes from various sources which include ripple relays, load limiting through smart meters, and Kelvin Power station.” “It is for this reason why City Power was able to cushion our customers against Stage 2 Loadshedding on Thursday and will be able to throughout the weekend.” “City Power customers should not panic, and we will update when this situation changes,” it added. Despite this extra capacity, City Power urged its Johannesburg customers to use electricity sparingly, as the system remains constrained.
