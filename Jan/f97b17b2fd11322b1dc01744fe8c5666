Telkom is offering employees voluntary separation packages as part of its plan to reduce the number of staff at the company, with payouts to staff based on the number of years they have worked at Telkom. According to a Telkom document seen by MyBroadband, Telkom has told staff that the cuts will take place in two phases. Telkom went on to provide reasons for the job cuts. In the Consumer division, the cuts are a result of the business evolving away from a traditional copper-based service supplier. It added that its “legacy operating model” is not aligned to “digital/mobile customer requirements” – and shared the follow graphic with staff as an explanation.
