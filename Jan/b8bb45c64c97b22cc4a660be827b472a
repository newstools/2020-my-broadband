Two Eskom employees, as well as two foreign nationals employed by a scrap metal dealership, have been arrested for alleged conductor theft. Eskom issued a statement confirming that the four suspects were arrested yesterday following a tip-off and “intensive internal investigations.” “Our employees were tracked to a scrap metal dealership in the far east of Johannesburg waiting in an Eskom truck loaded with aluminium conductor estimated at R468,000,” said Mothibane Ramashi, Eskom’s senior manager of maintenance and operations in Gauteng. Ramashi said that this aluminium was intended to be delivered to the scrapyard on Wednesday evening. “The South African Police Service (SAPS) was called and on arrival, a search was conducted and additional Eskom conductors were found inside the dealership.” Ramashi said that beyond remaining in police custody, the employees will be subject to its internal disciplinary processes. “We are disappointed and concerned that more of our own are implicated in alleged theft of our own material, but we will root out the rot even if it comes from within.” Ramashi said this should send a strong signal to anyone else involved in such illegal activities – highlighting that a week ago, another employee was arrested in connection with a similar incident. “We will continue to heighten efforts to curb material losses and any criminal act by anyone, including our employees.” Ramashi said that anyone aware of criminal acts by Eskom employees or anyone else should take pictures of the crime and the involved vehicle registration numbers when it is safe to do so, and send an anonymous tip-off to Crime Line on 32211 or contact the Eskom Contact Centre on 086 003 7566. <img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-336808" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/eskom-stolen-aluminiumm-640x430.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="430" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/eskom-stolen-aluminiumm.jpg 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/eskom-stolen-aluminiumm-595x400.jpg 595w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/eskom-stolen-aluminiumm-300x202.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> <img class="aligncenter wp-image-336810" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/eskom-stolen-aluminium-2-573x430.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="480" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/eskom-stolen-aluminium-2-573x430.jpg 573w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/eskom-stolen-aluminium-2-533x400.jpg 533w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/eskom-stolen-aluminium-2.jpg 720w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" />
