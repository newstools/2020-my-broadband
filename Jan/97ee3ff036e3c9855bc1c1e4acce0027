Western Digital-owned SanDisk has demonstrated a prototype of what it labelled the world’s highest capacity pocket-sized SSD at CES 2020. The largest-capacity portable SSDs which are generally available from retailers provide 2TB of storage, although rare 4TB SSDs can also be found. SanDisk’s prototype offers double this storage, with a total capacity of 8TB and support for SuperSpeed 20Gbps transfer rates. Western Digital also launched its SanDisk Ultra Dual Drive Luxe, an all-metal USB-C thumb drive with a maximum capacity of 1TB. The drive allows for easy transfer of files to and from smartphones, tablets, computers, and laptops that use USB-C connectors. It comes in a small form-factor which is designed to fit on a keychain. Western Digital said the drive will be available later this year with a price tag of $249 (R3,500). Western Digital also showcased its portfolio of gaming storage drives for PCs and consoles. These include the WD Black P50 Game Drive, which Western Digital called the industry’s first gaming drive that boasts a SuperSpeed USB 20Gbps interface. The company also highlighted its WD Black P10 5TB and D10 12TB Game Drives for Xbox One at the event. These hard drives are licensed by Xbox and provide performance-enhancing tools for optimal game loading.
