MyBroadband’s Q4 2019 fixed-broadband speed test results reveal that CipherWave, Supersonic, and Cool Ideas are the Internet service providers (ISPs) with the highest average speeds. These rankings are based on 390,530 speed tests which were performed using the MyBroadband Android and iOS speed test apps. The ISP speed rankings excluded all mobile speed tests which were not performed on a fixed-broadband connection. MyBroadband’s speed test servers are hosted in Teraco’s vendor-neutral data centres to ensure a neutral testing environment. Through NAPAfrica, all network operators present at its peering points are provided with a free 10Gbps connection to the MyBroadband Speed Test platform. The table below provides an overview of the average speed per ISP, ranked according to download speed. It should be noted that the average speed can encompass a variety of technologies, including wireless, ADSL, VDSL, and fibre. An ISP with predominantly ADSL and low-end fibre subscribers is therefore at a big disadvantage when compared to a fibre-only ISP.
