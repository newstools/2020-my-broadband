MSI has unveiled the Creator 17 laptop, which it said is the first notebook to feature a Mini LED display. The laptop employs small LEDs that are typically under 2mm in size, which provide targeted backlighting to the screen’s pixels, instead of the conventional LED backlighting found in many modern displays. “This technology enables 240 zones of local dimming control, delivering the vibrant visuals with the brightest whites and deepest blacks with sharper, more detailed imagery,” MSI said. “As the name suggests, in simple terms, the Mini LED backlight is thinner, miniaturized, and arrayed, resulting in light emission uniformity to a greater degree than its predecessors.” Additionally, Mini LED displays do not suffer from screen burn-in or image persistence, which can occur in conventional LCD displays. The laptop’s LEDs increase the high dynamic range of the display, which enhances its contrast ratio and colour accuracy. “The Creator 17 Mini LED display is so far the only laptop panel which can reach the high dynamic range (HDR) 1000 standard and achieve white luminance of 1,000 nits,” MSI explained. To top this off, the Creator 17 boasts a 4K resolution and a wide colour gamut of 100% DCI-P3. These attributes make it ideally-suited to content creators working with imagery that requires “close-to-real” colour accuracy or users looking for a high-quality video experience. The Creator 17 comes with the first USB Type-C port that supports outputting an 8K image to an external display, MSI said. The company said that the laptop includes the “latest in CPU and GPU processing power”, but did not provide exact specifications of its components. Pricing, launch date, and availability for the device are still to be confirmed. MSI provided an image which details the differences between different types of LED dimming and Mini LED dimming, shown below. <img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-334534" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Screenshot-2020-01-08-at-16.32.09-640x243.png" alt="" width="640" height="243" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Screenshot-2020-01-08-at-16.32.09-640x243.png 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Screenshot-2020-01-08-at-16.32.09-600x228.png 600w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Screenshot-2020-01-08-at-16.32.09-768x292.png 768w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Screenshot-2020-01-08-at-16.32.09.png 1196w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> <img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-334524" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/MSI-Creator-17_2-640x430.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="430" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/MSI-Creator-17_2.jpeg 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/MSI-Creator-17_2-595x400.jpeg 595w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/MSI-Creator-17_2-300x202.jpeg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> <img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-334532" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/MSI-Creator-17_4-640x430.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="430" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/MSI-Creator-17_4.jpeg 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/MSI-Creator-17_4-595x400.jpeg 595w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/MSI-Creator-17_4-300x202.jpeg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" />
