Samsung is expected to launch its next generation of flagship Galaxy S smartphones on 11 February. The company has sent out an invitation to its Galaxy Unpacked 2020 event taking place in San Francisco on this date. Samsung said it will unveil “new, innovative devices that will shape the next decade of mobile experiences”. Reports suggest that it will call the new flagship range the S20 series, as this is similar to how Huawei jumped from its P10 devices to the P20 name. Samsung will reportedly reveal three different Galaxy S20 models – a 6.2-inch Galaxy S20, 6.7-inch Galaxy S20 Plus, and a 6.9-inch Galaxy S20 Ultra. Samsung’s invite included a short teaser video showing the word “Galaxy” – with the two “A” letters covered with white boxes. XDA has suggested the first box could be the shape of the penta-camera setup on incoming Galaxy S devices, while the second box points to Samsung’s rumoured new clamshell foldable smartphone. The follow-up to Samsung’s Galaxy Fold has been teased by the company itself – and will reportedly boast a 6.7-inch display and be more affordable than the Galaxy Fold. <span data-mce-type="bookmark" style="display: inline-block; width: 0px; overflow: hidden; line-height: 0;" class="mce_SELRES_start">﻿</span>
