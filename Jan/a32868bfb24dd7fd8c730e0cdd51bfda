The company said its Galaxy A smartphones have become “one of the most beloved smartphone ranges”, and the new devices will continue this trend. “We know that people want a device that looks good, lasts longer, and captures every experience as it happens – and we’re proud to continue to deliver on those needs with the latest Galaxy A devices.” Both the A51 and A71 feature quad-sensor camera units on the rear, with the A71 packing a 64MP + 5MP + 5MP + 12MP array. These camera units include main, ultra-wide, macro, and depth lenses, combined with “intelligent features” to take enhanced photos, said Samsung.
