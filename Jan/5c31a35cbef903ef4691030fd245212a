Google is one of the largest companies in the world, with products and services offered by the tech giant spanning a variety of markets. It is famous for its search engine and products such as Gmail and Google Drive, as well as its market-leading Chrome browser. However, many users dislike the fact that one company has such extensive access to their data. These users have various options if they want to rid themselves of Google-operated software. Here are some of the best replacements for Google products and services. DuckDuckGo has become increasingly popular in recent times due to its position as a privacy-focused alternative to Google. It has three key selling points which it says are reasons it is a better choice than Google for privacy-minded users: This combination means that websites and advertisers are unable to target you with advertisements based upon your interests and previous activity. It also offers various features you will be used to from Google Search – such as image search, video search, and Wikipedia sidebars. <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-292004" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/DuckDuckGo.png" alt="DuckDuckGo" width="640" height="431" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/DuckDuckGo.png 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/DuckDuckGo-300x202.png 300w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/DuckDuckGo-594x400.png 594w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/DuckDuckGo-639x430.png 639w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> Mozilla Firefox has long been the most serious competitor to Google Chrome, and it continues to offer an impressive experience that makes it a great option. Germany’s Federal Office for Information Security has conducted tests which found that Firefox is the most secure mainstream browser in the world – beating Chrome, Internet Explorer, and Edge. Firefox also blocks over 2,000 trackers and offers additional features including Firefox Monitor, which alerts you if your information is part of another company’s data breach, and Firefox Lockwise, which secures passwords you save in Firefox and makes them available on your other devices. Firefox is open-source, which is another reason that it may be an attractive alternative to the highly-commercial Google environment for many users. <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-282307" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Firefox.jpg" alt="Firefox" width="640" height="430" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Firefox.jpg 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Firefox-300x202.jpg 300w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Firefox-595x400.jpg 595w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> Dropbox is a well-known name in the cloud storage market, and for good reason. It offers free storage through its Dropbox Basic product to users – much like Google Drive does. Dropbox Basic users get 2GB of free storage, and can access stored files on a number of platforms including Windows, Mac, Web, iOS, and Android. Users can also back anything up to their Dropbox account by storing it in the Dropbox folder on their computer. File recovery and versions can be restored up until 30 days after they were originally saved – a useful feature if you mistakenly delete your files or make unwanted changes to a document. <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-178216" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/DropBox-logo.jpg" alt="DropBox logo" width="640" height="430" /> While Dropbox is great, Microsoft Office Online is a reason to consider using OneDrive instead. Office Online allows users to access an interface that is very similar to that of the traditional Microsoft Office applications and offers a variety of templates and similar features to the traditional Office programmes. Programmes available with Office Online include Word, Excel, PowerPoint, OneNote, Outlook, and Skype. Documents are automatically saved to your OneDrive account – making the use of OneDrive even easier if you also use Microsoft Word Online. <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-212636" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Office-365-logo.jpg" alt="Office 365 logo" width="640" height="430" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Office-365-logo.jpg 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Office-365-logo-300x202.jpg 300w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Office-365-logo-595x400.jpg 595w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" />
