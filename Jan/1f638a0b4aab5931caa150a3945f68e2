Samsung recently revealed its two latest high-end, but affordable, smartphones – the Galaxy S10 Lite and Galaxy Note 10 Lite. The smartphones “build on the legacy” of their Galaxy S and Galaxy Note predecessors, and bring “key premium features at an accessible price point”, said Samsung. However, while they sport different names, the devices are quite similar. Both feature 6.7-inch 2,400 x 1,080 AMOLED displays, 4,500mAh batteries, 6GB or 8GB of RAM, and 128GB internal plus microSD 1TB storage. Both phones also run Android 10. There are several key differences between the devices, though, with certain elements more pronounced than others. This includes the use of a 10nm 64-bit octa-core chipset in the Note 10 Lite versus a 7nm 64-bit octa-core chip in the S10 Lite. The Note 10 Lite’s body is also marginally bigger and heavier than the S10 Lite. Samsung has highlighted the biggest differences between the devices as the camera system and S Pen stylus, however. Galaxy S10 Lite users will have access to a 5MP + 48MP + 12MP triple-sensor camera on the rear, which when paired with “Super Steady OIS” provides higher stability for photos and videos. The Note 10 Lite also features a triple-sensor system, but it is a 12MP + 12MP + 12MP setup. Samsung’s S Pen, a well-known companion to Note device users, returns with the Note 10 Lite – and promises to “enhance productivity” for users, said Samsung. “Bluetooth Low-Energy support means you can navigate a presentation, control your video content, or take a picture – all with a simple click of the S Pen,” it said. Conversely, the S10 Lite does not feature an S Pen stylus. The infographics below, from Samsung, provide a brief overview of the devices’ differences. Pricing and launch dates for the smartphones were not disclosed by Samsung at the time of writing. <img class="aligncenter wp-image-334048" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Galaxy-S10-Lite-Infographic.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="938" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Galaxy-S10-Lite-Infographic.jpg 1000w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Galaxy-S10-Lite-Infographic-273x400.jpg 273w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Galaxy-S10-Lite-Infographic-293x430.jpg 293w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Galaxy-S10-Lite-Infographic-768x1126.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> <img class="aligncenter wp-image-334046" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Galaxy-Note-10-Lite-Infographic.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="938" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Galaxy-Note-10-Lite-Infographic.jpg 1000w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Galaxy-Note-10-Lite-Infographic-273x400.jpg 273w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Galaxy-Note-10-Lite-Infographic-293x430.jpg 293w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Galaxy-Note-10-Lite-Infographic-768x1126.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> The table below details the devices’ specifications. <img class="aligncenter wp-image-333926 size-large" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Samsung-S10-Lite-640x426.jpg" alt="Samsung S10 Lite" width="640" height="426" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Samsung-S10-Lite-640x426.jpg 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Samsung-S10-Lite-600x400.jpg 600w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Samsung-S10-Lite-768x511.jpg 768w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Samsung-S10-Lite.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> <img class="aligncenter wp-image-333932 size-large" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Samsung-Note-10-Lite-copy-640x426.jpg" alt="Samsung Note 10 Lite" width="640" height="426" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Samsung-Note-10-Lite-copy-640x426.jpg 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Samsung-Note-10-Lite-copy-600x400.jpg 600w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Samsung-Note-10-Lite-copy-768x511.jpg 768w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Samsung-Note-10-Lite-copy.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" />
