Bluetooth SIG has announced the upcoming release of Bluetooth LE Audio – an update to its wireless audio technology. LE Audio will implement the Low Complexity Communication Codec (LC3), which offers higher audio quality and lower power usage. “LC3 will bring tremendous flexibility to developers, allowing them to make better design tradeoffs between key product attributes such as audio quality and power consumption,” said Bluetooth SIG. The technology will also enable devices to transmit numerous synchronised audio streams simultaneously between the source and audio devices. “Developers will be able to use the Multi-Stream Audio feature to improve the performance of products like truly wireless earbuds,” said Nick Hunn, Chair of the Bluetooth SIG Hearing Aid Working Group. “For example, they can provide a better stereo imaging experience, make the use of voice assistant services more seamless, and make switching between multiple audio source devices smoother.” The combination of low power usage, high-quality audio, and multi-stream audio also means that Bluetooth LE Audio will be able to support hearing aids and implants. “Engineers have contributed their specialist knowledge to improve the audio experience especially for hard of hearing people,” said Stefan Zimmer, secretary general of the European Hearing Instrument Manufacturers Association (EHIMA). “As a result, within a few years most new phones and TVs will be equally accessible to users with hearing loss.” Bluetooth LE Audio specifications are expected to be released in the first half of 2020.
