MTN announced today that it has dropped its case against Nigeria’s Attorney-General. “Today, MTN Nigeria appeared before a Federal High Court in Lagos, Nigeria to formally discontinue its legal action against the Attorney General of the Federal Republic of Nigeria and Minister of Justice (the AGF),” the company said. “This follows from the decision of the AGF to hand the matter over to the relevant regulatory authorities.” MTN Nigeria previously filed a lawsuit after the AGF issued a demand for unpaid duties and taxes, with the company challenging the authority of the AGF to deal with issues around tax and custom duties. Nigeria dropped its $2-billion tax claim against MTN group earlier this month, ending the 16-month long fight between the company and the Attorney-General. The company’s share price surged following that announcement, and MTN has now laid the matter to rest by dropping its legal action. The mobile operator said it remains committed to its Nigerian market, where it has around 65 million customers. “MTN remains committed to meeting its fiscal responsibilities and contributing to the social and economic development of Nigeria in collaboration with all stakeholders,” the company said.
