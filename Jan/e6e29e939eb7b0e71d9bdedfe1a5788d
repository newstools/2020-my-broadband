Communications Workers Union (CWU) Secretary-General Aubrey Tshabalala said Telkom workers must be defended against the company’s CEO, Sipho Maseko. Telkom recently announced that it is planning to cut as many as 3,000 jobs across the company to compensate for poor earnings and its dismal share-price performance. Telkom told MyBroadband that it has served unions with letters regarding the Section 189 process. “Telkom will continue to consult with the unions, and it is our hope that through considered engagement with the unions, we will come to a mutually beneficial solution,” the company said. This did not sit well with the CWU, and Tshabalala said they will fight the job cuts and urged workers to unite against the onslaught from Telkom. Tshabalala took aim at Telkom CEO Sipho Maseko and former chairperson Jabu Mabuza, saying their corporate plan failed. He said Telkom’s management “is eager to just dismiss workers” which is a reflection that the privatization of state-owned enterprise (SOE) yields no results. He said since parts of Telkom were sold to private investors in the mid-nineties, the number of workers at Telkom declined tremendously. “We keep on warning the government that giving away institutions like Telkom means you lose infrastructure, security, and the ownership of the industry itself,” said Tshabalala. “This is an ongoing onslaught on workers and the latest job cuts at Telkom means it is now or never – workers must unite against privatization at all fronts.” “We must make sure that we defend workers against neo-liberalists from The Treasury right through to Pravin Gordhan and Sipho Maseko,” he said. <span data-mce-type="bookmark" style="display: inline-block; width: 0px; overflow: hidden; line-height: 0;" class="mce_SELRES_start">﻿</span>
