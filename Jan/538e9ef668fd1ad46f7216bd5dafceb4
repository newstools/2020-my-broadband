Eskom has announced that it will implement stage 2 load-shedding the whole of Sunday and early Monday morning. The system remains constrained and load-shedding stage 2 will continue until 05:00 Monday morning, said Eskom. This follows Eskom implementing stage 2 load-shedding on Saturday night. “Owing to an unanticipated conveyor belt failure at Medupi power station, the system is currently severely constrained and vulnerable,” Eskom stated at the time. It stated that load-shedding was needed in order to replenish both the water levels at its pumped storage schemes and diesel for the open cycle gas turbines to create adequate reserve capacity before South Africans return to work in the coming week. Eskom maintained that its teams were working “tirelessly” to return units back from planned and unplanned outages. The latest load-shedding announcement also follows a report that Eskom wants R1.8 billion in performance bonuses for staff. Rapport reported that the National Energy Regulator of South Africa (Nersa) said Eskom did not reveal this plan in its tariff applications.
