Samsung has revealed two new curved Odyssey gaming monitors, the Odyssey G7 and Odyssey G9. “The new line-up has been completely reimagined with gamers in mind, including radically new curved displays and industry-leading performance features for a whole new way to game,” Samsung stated. “Both monitors feature an extremely deep curvature – the first ever monitors to possess a high-performance 1000R curvature with stunning QLED picture quality,” the company said. The top-of-the-line G9 boasts a 49-inch display with a resolution of 5,120×1,440 and a 240Hz refresh rate. Samsung has called it the “world’s first Dual Quad High-Definition” display. It also features a 1ms response time and 1000 cd/m2 peak brightness. For the G9’s design, Samsung opted for a white gloss on the back and stand, with a glowing rear core that can display 52 colours and five different lighting effects. Its smaller sibling, the G7, will be available in two variants – a 32-inch and 27-inch model. The G7 offers the same response time and refresh rate as the G9, with a resolution of up to 2,560 × 1,440 and a peak brightness of 600 cd/m2. It comes with a matte black exterior and sports a rear core light that can remain static or dim during gameplay – with colours that can be adjusted according the user’s preferences. Both of the monitors are G-Sync compatible and will be available globally in Q2 2020. <img class="aligncenter wp-image-333970 size-large" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/2020-Odyssey-Gaming-Monitors-G9_product1-e1578117410862-640x427.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="427" /> <img class="aligncenter wp-image-333972 size-large" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/2020-Odyssey-Gaming-Monitors-G9_product2-scaled-e1578117389785-630x430.jpg" alt="" width="630" height="430" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/2020-Odyssey-Gaming-Monitors-G9_product2-scaled-e1578117389785-630x430.jpg 630w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/2020-Odyssey-Gaming-Monitors-G9_product2-scaled-e1578117389785-586x400.jpg 586w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/2020-Odyssey-Gaming-Monitors-G9_product2-scaled-e1578117389785-768x524.jpg 768w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/2020-Odyssey-Gaming-Monitors-G9_product2-scaled-e1578117389785-1536x1048.jpg 1536w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/2020-Odyssey-Gaming-Monitors-G9_product2-scaled-e1578117389785-2048x1397.jpg 2048w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/2020-Odyssey-Gaming-Monitors-G9_product2-scaled-e1578117389785-1200x818.jpg 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> <img class="aligncenter wp-image-333966 size-large" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/2020-Odyssey-Gaming-Monitors-G7_product1-2-e1578117955183-640x430.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="430" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/2020-Odyssey-Gaming-Monitors-G7_product1-2-e1578117955183-640x430.jpg 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/2020-Odyssey-Gaming-Monitors-G7_product1-2-e1578117955183-595x400.jpg 595w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/2020-Odyssey-Gaming-Monitors-G7_product1-2-e1578117955183-300x202.jpg 300w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/2020-Odyssey-Gaming-Monitors-G7_product1-2-e1578117955183-768x516.jpg 768w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/2020-Odyssey-Gaming-Monitors-G7_product1-2-e1578117955183-1536x1033.jpg 1536w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/2020-Odyssey-Gaming-Monitors-G7_product1-2-e1578117955183-2048x1377.jpg 2048w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/2020-Odyssey-Gaming-Monitors-G7_product1-2-e1578117955183-1200x807.jpg 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> <img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-333968" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/2020-Odyssey-Gaming-Monitors-G7_product2-640x365.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="365" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/2020-Odyssey-Gaming-Monitors-G7_product2-640x365.jpg 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/2020-Odyssey-Gaming-Monitors-G7_product2-600x342.jpg 600w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/2020-Odyssey-Gaming-Monitors-G7_product2-768x438.jpg 768w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/2020-Odyssey-Gaming-Monitors-G7_product2-1536x876.jpg 1536w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/2020-Odyssey-Gaming-Monitors-G7_product2-2048x1168.jpg 2048w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/2020-Odyssey-Gaming-Monitors-G7_product2-1200x684.jpg 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" />
