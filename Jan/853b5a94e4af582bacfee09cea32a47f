Lenovo South Africa has launched the new ThinkBook range in South Africa. “ThinkBook is intended to shift SMB customers away from consumer-oriented devices,” said Matej Misturik, Commercial Product Manager for ThinkPad for the EMEA region. Misturik said that Lenovo prioritised creating a device that also appeals to younger generations while still offering them everything they need in terms of performance. “When you are an entrepreneur, freelancer, or another job that isn’t a nine-to-five, your expectation of the device is that it looks good,” said Misturik. He added that the primary difference between the ThinkPad and the ThinkBook is that the ThinkPad has a variety of high-end security and manageability features that the ThinkBook market doesn’t require – allowing Lenovo to offer devices that offer better value to this market. The Lenovo ThinkBook range in South Africa comprises four devices – the ThinkBook 13s, 14, 15, and Plus. The ThinkBook 13s is the smallest of these devices, and sports up to an 8th-generation Intel Core processor, M.2 storage, and a fingerprint reader. The 14-inch and 15-inch ThinkBooks have larger displays and offer up to a 10th-generation i7 processor. Both of these devices also offer a “magic port”, which allows users to insert a USB dongle – for a keyboard or a mouse, for example  – without it jutting out the side of laptop. <img class="aligncenter wp-image-336144" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/IMG_20200123_203804-573x430.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="480" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/IMG_20200123_203804-573x430.jpg 573w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/IMG_20200123_203804-533x400.jpg 533w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/IMG_20200123_203804-768x576.jpg 768w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/IMG_20200123_203804-1536x1152.jpg 1536w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/IMG_20200123_203804-2048x1536.jpg 2048w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/IMG_20200123_203804-1200x900.jpg 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> <img class="aligncenter wp-image-336146" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/IMG_20200123_203812-573x430.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="480" /> <img class="aligncenter wp-image-336148" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/IMG_20200123_203827-573x430.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="480" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/IMG_20200123_203827-573x430.jpg 573w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/IMG_20200123_203827-533x400.jpg 533w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/IMG_20200123_203827-768x576.jpg 768w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/IMG_20200123_203827-1536x1152.jpg 1536w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/IMG_20200123_203827-2048x1536.jpg 2048w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/IMG_20200123_203827-1200x900.jpg 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> <img class="aligncenter wp-image-336150" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/IMG_20200123_203754-573x430.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="480" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/IMG_20200123_203754-573x430.jpg 573w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/IMG_20200123_203754-533x400.jpg 533w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/IMG_20200123_203754-768x576.jpg 768w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/IMG_20200123_203754-1536x1152.jpg 1536w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/IMG_20200123_203754-2048x1536.jpg 2048w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/IMG_20200123_203754-1200x900.jpg 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" />
