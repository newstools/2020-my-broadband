Eskom has stated that stage 1 load-shedding will be implemented from 06:00 to 23:00 today, 10 January. This follows several consecutive days of load-shedding across South Africa – including stage 2 load-shedding which ran from 08:00 on Thursday to 06:00 this morning. “The system remains vulnerable to unplanned outages or breakdowns, which are 12,098MW as at 04:00 on Friday morning,” said Eskom. Bloomberg reported this week that South African business confidence slumped to the lowest level in 34 years in 2019 as the country faces continued power cuts. Energy advisor Ted Blom has stated that Eskom should create 5,000MW of space on the grid and use this additional capacity to take generating units offline and do proper maintenance on power plants. He said the full fleet of Eskom’s old power stations needed proper maintenance and refurbishment, which will take between three and four years. A possible avenue to accomplish this is through power barges – also known as powerships – or similar programmes. Powerships are cost-effective, privately owned and operated floating power stations which can be moored at South African harbours. #POWERALERT1
