Sensor Tower has published its report detailing the most downloaded mobile apps of 2019. The researchers used per-user download figures from the Google Play Store and Apple App Store to determine the total number of downloads for each app. The group found that worldwide app downloads reached 114.9 billion in 2019, an increase of 9.1% over the previous year. Of those downloads, 84.3 billion were on the Google Play Store and 30.6 billion on the Apple App Store. Google surpassed Facebook as the top app publisher in the quarter for the first time in five years, but Facebook was still the best performer over the course of 2019. TikTok, still reeling from reports over severe security flaws, boasted 27% quarter-on-quarter growth and finished the year as the number two app on overall global downloads. WhatsApp held on to the top spot, with over 850 million downloads. It was also the most downloaded app on the Google Play Store for Q4 2019. On the App Store, TikTok claimed the number one position with more than 40 million downloads in Q4. The lists below show the top 10 overall app downloads from both stores, as well as the most downloaded apps from Q4 for each platform. <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-325813" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/WhatsApp-headline-.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="430" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/WhatsApp-headline-.jpg 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/WhatsApp-headline--300x202.jpg 300w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/WhatsApp-headline--595x400.jpg 595w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> <img class="aligncenter wp-image-146533 size-full" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Google-Play.jpg" alt="Google Play" width="640" height="430" /> <img class="aligncenter wp-image-335336 size-large" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/App-Store-640x430.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="430" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/App-Store.jpg 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/App-Store-595x400.jpg 595w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/App-Store-300x202.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" />
