Nvidia may add two new GTX 16-series graphics cards to its mobile GPU lineup in the near future. This is according to Geekbench scores identified by Twitter user @_rogame which showed an unknown Lenovo laptop running a GeForce GTX 1650 Ti. The card’s specifications include 1,024 CUDA cores, 16 compute units, a 1.49GHz clock speed, and 4GB of GDDR6 VRAM. The current GeForce GTX 1650 laptop GPU has similar specifications but uses older GDDR5 VRAM. Another unidentified NVIDIA “Graphics Device” showed 14 compute units, a maximum clock speed of 1.56GHz, and 4GB of GDDR6 VRAM. @_rogame said that this could be an updated version of the mobile GTX 1650, although it may also be a Super edition of the card. The GTX 1650 and GTX 1660 cards are intended for high-performance gaming at 1080p resolution. When it comes to laptop GPUs, Nvidia has dominated the gaming market in recent years. The updated GTX 1650 series could be the company’s answer to AMD’s recently announced RX 5600M card, which is also intended for solid mid-range gaming performance. Another recently-revealed card, the 5700M mobile GPU, is set to compete with Nvidia’s top mid-range GPU – The GTX 1660 Ti.
