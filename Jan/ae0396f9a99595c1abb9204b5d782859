Cool Ideas is increasing its fibre prices for users on the Openserve and Vumatel networks, the company announced in an email sent to customers. Along with the price increase details, Cool Ideas provided an explanation for the changes. “All of the fibre networks that we operate on, operate on an open-access principle – where ISPs lease the line from the fibre network at a wholesale price,” said Cool Ideas. “We then supply our internet service over the fibre line.” “In an ever-growing industry and within a highly-competitive environment, we have avoided price increases for as long as possible by absorbing Fibre Network Operator price increases ourselves,” it said. “Unfortunately, annual price increases and package changes from Openserve are a reality, and not something we control, and this year we are forced to increase some of our subscriptions.” The ISP said that these price increases were implemented in light of the package and rate changes from both Openserve and Vumatel. The new prices will come into effect from 1 March 2020. Cool Ideas did not immediately respond to a request for comment on these fibre price changes. The new Vumatel and Openserve fibre package prices are detailed below, along with the old price for each package. The new pricing for Cool Ideas packages on Openserve is below. <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-183296" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Openserve-1.jpg" alt="openserve" width="640" height="430" /> The new pricing for Cool Ideas packages on Vumatel is below.
