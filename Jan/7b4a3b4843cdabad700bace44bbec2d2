The Pirate Bay has retaken its spot as the world’s most popular torrent site, according to TorrentFreak’s rankings for 2020. TorrentFreak publishes its list of the most popular Torrent sites at the beginning of every year. It noted that over the past year, the list of most popular sites has remained relatively stable, meaning that none of the world’s major torrent sites were taken down in 2019. In recent years, The Pirate Bay has faced problems with outages and other downtime, causing downloaders to seek out other torrent indexing sites. However, The Pirate Bay has been relatively stable over the past year, TorrentFreak said, allowing it to regain the audience it lost during its period of instability. TorrentFreak uses Alexa and other metrics to rank the torrent sites on its top 10 list. It acknowledged in a disclaimer that Alexa is not a perfect way to measure the popularity of a site, but said that it does help to compare sites that operate in a similar niche. “We also use other traffic metrics to compile the top ten. Please keep in mind that many sites have mirrors or alternative domains, which are not taken into account here,” TorrentFreak said. “We don’t encourage the use of any of these sites, the yearly list is published as an informational / news resource.”
