DStv has announced that it will bring more shows from its higher-level bouquets to DStv Compact subscribers. MultiChoice offers customers a number of DStv packages at different pricing tiers. These packages include different channels and perks. For example, DStv Compact is priced at R399 per month and offers viewers 118 channels, which exclude a number of popular movie and sports broadcasts. DStv Premium offers 150 channels and is priced at R809 per month, but includes everything available on the platform and a free subscription to Showmax. There is good news for DStv Compact subscribers who missed out on popular shows exclusive to higher bouquets, however – DStv is bringing a number of shows to channels available on its Compact package. “Love Being Bonang and The Real Housewives of Johannesburg? Missed out on Idols or Marry Me Now?” DStv said. “The good news is that Compact subscribers can now see these shows and more, as they will be rebroadcast on either Mzansi Magic or Mzansi Wethu.” Shows coming to the Compact bouquet of channels include the locally-produced Grassroots and the Real Housewives of Johannesburg. Both of these shows were previously only available on 1Magic and Showmax. The rebroadcasts of these titles will be shown on Mzansi Magic (channel 161) and Mzansi Wethu (channel 163). Below is the full list of new shows coming to DStv Compact.
