Acer announced two additions to its TravelMate notebook range – the TravelMate B3 and the convertible TravelMate Spin B3 – which are both targeted at school learners. “The portable 11.6-inch notebooks come with enhanced performance and sport a sturdy design to protect them from the knocks of school life, ideal for use both in-school and out-of-school,” said Acer. These devices use Pentium and Celeron processors, and comply with the MIL-STD 810G military standard for ruggedness. Durability features included with both laptops include a pressure-resistant top cover, shock-absorbent rubber bumpers, and reinforced corners. The battery lasts for up to 12 hours on a single charge, meaning school learners shouldn’t need to charge their laptop at all throughout the school day. The TravelMate Spin B3 is the convertible version of the standard TravelMate B3, and offers four usage modes – clamshell (traditional), display, tent, and tablet. This laptop also sports an optional rear camera which allows learners to take photos when using the device in tablet mode. It also comes with a dockable stylus. Both laptops will be available in April, with the TravelMate Spin B3’s price starting at R4,000. Acer has only provided the TravelMate B3’s US pricing, which starts at $300. Acer also launched a 12-inch Chromebook – the Chromebook 712 – which is also designed for the education sector. It sports up to a 10th-generation Intel Core i3 processor, and also lasts up to 12 hours on a single charge. It also offers various durability features including a reinforced hinge and replaceable mechanical keys, and can withstand up to 60kg of downward force. The Chromebook 712 supports Wi-Fi 6 and offers users an HD+ display. The Acer Chromebook 712 will be available in the EMEA region in April and pricing will begin at R4,800. <img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-336064" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Chromebook-712-640x430.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="430" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Chromebook-712-640x430.jpg 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Chromebook-712-595x400.jpg 595w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Chromebook-712-300x202.jpg 300w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Chromebook-712-768x517.jpg 768w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Chromebook-712-1200x807.jpg 1200w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Chromebook-712.jpg 1500w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" />
