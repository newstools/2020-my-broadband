Intel has showcased a large-screen prototype folding tablet at CES 2020, according to a report by Engadget. The device is codenamed “Horseshoe Bend” and sports a 17.3-inch OLED display with a 4:3 aspect ratio. The tablet’s thickness measures at 7mm, which is achieved thanks to the implementation of an Intel Tiger Lake UP4 mobile processor. On its back, the Horseshoe Bend is covered in black leather and includes a built-in kickstand. Both Engadget and The Verge were able to try out the tablet and found the design to be sleeker than Lenovo’s recently-unveiled ThinkPad X1 Fold, which was also on stage at Intel’s keynote at CES 2020. This was reportedly attributed to its smaller bezels, thinner profile, and the matte metallic finish along its edges. The new prototype follows two previous foldable concepts from Intel – Tiger Rapids and Twin Rivers. As was the case with those devices, there are no plans to make the Horseshoe Bend tablet commercially available, but the testing unit could provide valuable insights for development going forward. Engadget stated this prototype could indicate that Intel and its partners are planning to roll out more large foldable tablets and laptops in the near future.
