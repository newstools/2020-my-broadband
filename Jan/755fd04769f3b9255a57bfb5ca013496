Chinese smartphone manufacturer Coolpad unveiled its first 5G smartphone at CES 2020. The device is named the Legacy 5G and comes with a price tag of under $400 (R5,700). This makes it the most affordable 5G smartphone to be announced to date, beating out Motorola’s Moto Z4, a Verizon-exclusive handset which costs $440 (R6,300). The Legacy 5G’s Snapdragon X52 modem will run on sub-6GHz spectrum, Coolpad said. The phone features a 6.53-inch Full HD+ display and has a blue ombre finish on the rear of its chassis. It is powered by a Qualcomm 765 chipset paired with 4GB of RAM, and it includes 64GB of storage and a 4,000mAh battery. The camera setup comprises 48MP and 8MP sensors on the rear and a 16MP front camera. CNET stated that the camera’s interface was still unfinished, as its hands-on experience showed the lenses would not lock into focus. CNET also reported that the version of Android 10 the phone was running was still incomplete. Coolpad said the Legacy 5G will be launched in the second quarter of 2020. The smartphone will be available from Coolpad’s website, Amazon, and US retailers. The table below shows the specifications of the Coolpad Legacy 5G.
