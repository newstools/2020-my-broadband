Huawei has revealed that it is selling 100,000 Mate X foldable smartphones per month, Sina Finance reports. The Mate X was launched in mid-November, and Huawei said it has since sold about 200,000 units. This news follows Samsung announcing that it has sold between 400,000 and 500,000 Galaxy Fold smartphones since it launched the device in September 2019. A key difference, however, is that Huawei has only made its foldable smartphone available in China, whereas the Galaxy Fold is available in a variety of markets. The Mate X smartphone sells for 16,999 yuan (R35,000) – making it more expensive than its Samsung counterpart. Reports indicate that both Samsung and Huawei are could launch their second-generation foldable smartphones in 2020. Samsung’s heavily-rumoured second foldable smartphone is known as the Galaxy Bloom, and was reportedly shown to a secret meeting of CES 2020 attendees earlier this month. The Galaxy Bloom will use a clamshell design which is inspired by Lancôme – a French cosmetics company which is known for its foldable compact cases. It will reportedly be targeted at younger female users. Huawei is rumoured to be launching its second-generation foldable smartphone – the Mate XS – at MWC 2020 in Barcelona next month. The device will reportedly be powered by a Kirin 990 5G chipset and could offer 65W fast charging functionality. Unlike the Mate X, the upcoming Mate XS is expected to launch in markets outside of China.
