A new leak of tens of thousands of documents from Cambridge Analytica exposes the depth of Facebook manipulation, The Guardian reports. According to the report, over 100,000 documents concerning 68 countries are set to expose the full extent of Cambridge Analytica’s global operations. The release of these documents began on New Year’s Day on Twitter account @HindsightFiles, with election material regarding Malaysia, Kenya, Iran, and Brazil so far being highlighted. These documents are from former Cambridge Analytica employee and whistleblower Brittany Kaiser, and appear to include the same files that Robert Mueller subpoenaed during his investigation into Russian interference in the last US election. “It’s so abundantly clear our electoral systems are wide open to abuse,” Kaiser said. “I’m very fearful about what is going to happen in the US election later this year, and I think one of the few ways of protecting ourselves is to get as much information out there as possible.” Kaiser claims to have thousands of pages worth of documents which show how deep the Cambridge Analytica scandal actually runs. This includes materials which allegedly show that Cambridge Analytica was working for a Ukranian political party while under investigation from the US, and helped to develop a “sophisticated infrastructure of shell companies that were designed to funnel dark money into politics.” “There are emails between these major Trump donors discussing ways of obscuring the source of their donations through a series of different financial vehicles,” Kaiser said. “These documents expose the entire dark money machinery behind US politics.”
