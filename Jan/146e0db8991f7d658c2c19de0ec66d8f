Huawei and TomTom have agreed to a deal which will see Huawei replace Google’s Maps with TomTom maps in its smartphones, reported Reuters. This follows Huawei being forced to develop a smartphone ecosystem that doesn’t include Google products – including the Android operating – following its blacklisting by US President Donald Trump. According to a TomTom spokesperson, the deal between Huawei and TomTom was concluded a while ago, but had not been made public. Further details about the agreement have not been provided. TomTom, which is known for its GPS products that competed with the likes of Garmin, is transitioning into becoming a software-focused company – after selling its telematics division to Bridgestone last year. Despite its issues with the US, Bloomberg reported that Huawei recorded an 18% year-on-year increase in sales – showing that the company is still growing. However, this growth figure is down compared to the mid-year figure of 23%, and the company missed its own targets. Huawei executives have also warned employees that they should brace for a difficult 2020.
