The Independent Examination Board (IEB) matric class of 2019 has achieved a pass rate of 98.82%. This is a 0.1% decrease compared to 2018. The IEB exams are often used by private schools to test their pupils and are accredited by Umalusi – the same institution which accredits the Department of Education’s National Senior Certificate (NSC) exams. 12,595 pupils wrote the IEB exams in 2019, up from 12,372 in 2018, and achieved the following results: “There is a clear realisation among IEB learners, their parents and teachers that having the knowledge and understanding that lies behind the results on the certificate is far more important and meaningful for success after one’s schooling,” said the IEB. Advanced Programme courses are extension courses in Mathematics, English, and Afrikaans. Students attending either state or independent schools may choose to take this qualification. The assessment is considered to be equivalent to the UK’s A-levels. In 2019, 1,351 learners from IEB schools and 993 learners in state schools studied AP Mathematics. 67.36% achieved a pass above 40%, the IEB said. Of the 624 learners who studied AP English, 93.86% achieved a pass mark of 50% or above. All learners who studied AP Afrikaans achieved a mark of 40% and above. For public schools, the 2019 National Senior Certificate matric results will be announced by Minister of Basic Education, Angie Motshekga, on 7 January 2020. There are several ways learners can get their individual 2019 matric results – which can be found here.
