Dell has unveiled its latest high-end gaming monitor, the Alienware 25, which is aimed at esports enthusiasts and professionals. The 25-inch display features an IPS panel and 99% sRGB colour coverage – along with a 1ms response time and a 240Hz refresh rate. The company said the 240Hz refresh rate is “twice the speed” of most gaming monitors in the market today. “The new Alienware 25 gaming monitor provides the speed gamers need, coupled with the incredible colour details of IPS panels,” said Dell. To ensure there are no issues with tearing or stuttering when gaming, the monitor also supports dynamic refresh rates thanks to AMD Radeon FreeSync or Nvidia G-Sync compatibility. In terms of resolution, the Alienware 25 provide users with Full HD visuals – 1,920 x 1,080 – which is common in high-refresh-rate monitors made for competitive gaming. Another standout feature of the monitor is its stand and thin bezels. The adjustable stand was designed with thin legs which fit underneath a keyboard for up-close gaming, said Dell. The stand also includes “optimised ventilation” at the top, bottom, and rear side of the monitor to provide improved cooling – along with AlienFX customizable lighting zones which can respond to in-game events or user profiles. Dell said the Alienware 25 monitor (model number AW2521HF), will start at $499 and be available globally from 11 March 2020. Photos of the new monitor are shown below. <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-333896" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/21-1.jpg" alt="Alienware" width="700" height="556" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/21-1.jpg 700w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/21-1-504x400.jpg 504w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/21-1-541x430.jpg 541w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-333902" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/25-4.jpg" alt="Alienware" width="700" height="556" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/25-4.jpg 700w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/25-4-504x400.jpg 504w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/25-4-541x430.jpg 541w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-333900" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/25-3.jpg" alt="Alienware" width="700" height="556" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/25-3.jpg 700w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/25-3-504x400.jpg 504w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/25-3-541x430.jpg 541w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-333898" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/25-2.jpg" alt="Alienware" width="700" height="556" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/25-2.jpg 700w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/25-2-504x400.jpg 504w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/25-2-541x430.jpg 541w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-333904" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/25-5.jpg" alt="Alienware" width="700" height="556" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/25-5.jpg 700w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/25-5-504x400.jpg 504w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/25-5-541x430.jpg 541w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" />
