Apple plans to launch a high-end gaming computer in 2020, according to a report by Patently Apple. The website cites supply chain sources in Taiwan that claimed the company will unveil a Mac or Macbook computer aimed at esports enthusiasts, with a $5,000 (R70,000) price tag. Indications are that the company will either release a large-screen all-in-one Mac or large-screen MacBook laptop. No details have been revealed about what hardware could be expected. Although Appleâ€™s machines offer powerful components, gamers have long favoured Windows PCs over Macs. The main reasons are the optimised game compatibility of Windows, improved upgradability on desktop PCs, and more affordable hardware in a relatively expensive segment. Apple has hinted at becoming a contender in the gaming market in recent months. The company launched a subscription service for its own video gaming platform, Apple Arcade, in September. Arcade is focused on mobile and online games, and gives subscribers access to more than 100 titles. These games are considered to be more mainstream and do not require the type of graphics or processing power needed to run titles played in competitive esports tournaments. The esports industry has seen significant growth in recent years, and is projected to be worth over $1.5 billion by the end of 2023.
