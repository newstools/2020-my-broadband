The Agri Online store provides a safe and easy-to-use platform to buy, sell, and trade agricultural vehicles and equipment. Farming is a tough job which requires a wide range of equipment for optimal productivity. Buying and selling these tools can be a challenge for farmers who need to keep a constant eye on their farms, which are often located far from equipment traders. The difficulties in arranging a meet-up for a sale, the distances that need to be covered to view a product, and the time constraints placed on farmers all pose significant challenges. The Agri Online store provides a specialised platform to help farmers address these challenges. The site boasts a vast selection of agricultural implements, as well as heavy equipment and farming-capable vehicles. Among the implement selection users will find tractors, combine harvesters, ploughs, harrows, feeders, trailers, tanks, and much more. The heavy equipment available includes bulldozers, forklifts, excavators, TLBs, graders, and loaders. Additionally, used cars, trucks, bakkies, and boats are also on offer – as well as advertising space for auctions, livestock, and property. All of these products and services are easy to access thanks to the site’s user-friendly interface and clear-cut categories. While other popular ecommerce websites such as OLX and Gumtree advertise all manner of products, these sites are not aimed at farmers or agricultural players in particular, meaning there are many products which are not relevant to farmers. Agri Online is solely focused on providing services to the agricultural industry, making it a more suitable destination for farmers. To use the site as a buyer or seller, you are required to sign up. Alternatively, Agri Online is available as a convenient app for Android devices from the Google Play Store. The first three ads you post as a seller are free, after which you can opt for a monthly or annual paid package. Farmers and agricultural stakeholders need not be left out of the online shopping boom thanks to services like those offered by Agri Online. This article was published in partnership with Agri Online.
