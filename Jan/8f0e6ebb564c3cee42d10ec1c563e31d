Razer has launched its first desktop gaming computer at CES 2020 – the Razer Tomahawk. “Rethink what a rig should be with the Razer Tomahawk – a new breed of gaming desktops & chassis design that throws conventional PC gaming out the window,” said Razer. Rather than connecting conventional components to a traditional motherboard, the Tomahawk uses Intel’s Next Unit of Computing (NUC) architecture. The device boasts an Intel Core i9-9980HK mobile processor, slots for memory and storage, and a variety of connectivity ports. The Tomahawk will support up to 64GB RAM and the Nvidia GeForce RTX 2080 Super GPU, and Razer claims it will be able to use three 4K displays simultaneously. It also has two M.2 slots for powerful PCIe SSDs, as well as Gigabit Ethernet ports and Wi-Fi 6 support. The Tomahawk will be available as a complete desktop package from Razer, although Razer could also sell the case on its own and allow users to fit components themselves. Razer plans to begin shipping the full system in June, with the cheapest of these computers retailing for just over $2,000. Specifications and photos of the Razer Tomahawk are shown below. <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-334450" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Razer-Tomahawk.png" alt="Razer Tomahawk" width="640" height="431" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Razer-Tomahawk.png 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Razer-Tomahawk-594x400.png 594w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Razer-Tomahawk-300x202.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-334452" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Razer-Tomahawk-2.png" alt="Razer Tomahawk 2" width="640" height="431" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Razer-Tomahawk-2.png 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Razer-Tomahawk-2-594x400.png 594w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Razer-Tomahawk-2-300x202.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" />
