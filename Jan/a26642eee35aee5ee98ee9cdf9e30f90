Microsoft’s new Edge browser, which uses the same engine as Google Chrome, is now available for download. The updated version of Edge is based on Chromium, Google’s open-source web browser, and has been in beta testing for a year. Microsoft stated that the new browser was built “from the ground up” for “world-class compatibility and performance” with enhanced security and privacy features, making it the “only browser optimised for Windows 10”. The company has also retained Edge’s support for streaming Netflix content in 4K (3,840 x 2,160). This feature sets it apart from competitors like Chrome and Firefox, which only offer native support for 720p streaming, with extensions capable of adding 1080p streaming capability. Edge also boasts Dolby Audio and Dolby Vision compatibility. Upon its initial start-up, the new browser gives you the option of importing all of your bookmarks, history, and autofill data from Google Chrome. In terms of extension support, users will be able to install Microsoft Edge add-ons and third-party extensions from sources such as the Chrome Web Store. Edge also comes with inPrivate browsing, which works in a similar way as Google’s Incognito Mode. While inPrivate is activated, no browsing data is saved on the device after the session is ended. Microsoft stated that this feature will also keep browsing data off of any linked Microsoft account. Microsoft added that its new browser identifies trackers and will allow users to decide which of these to block. The new version of Edge will be rolled out to Windows 10 Home and Pro via a Windows update. It is also available as a standalone download for Windows 7, Windows 8.1, Windows 10, macOS, iOS, and Android.
