South African Internet users who are experiencing slow international connectivity speeds will have to wait until at least next week for the issue to be resolved. The slow international speeds are caused by “unusual and simultaneous dual cable breaks” on the WACS and SAT3/WASC systems, which occurred on 16 January. The WACS and SAT3/WASC cable systems are deployed in the Atlantic Ocean and connect various African countries to Europe – including South Africa. The WACS system enters South Africa at Yzerfontein in the Western Cape, while the SAT3/WASC system enters at Melkbosstrand, also in the Western Cape. For the cables to be fixed, a cable repair ship must travel to the location of the breaks. Adverse weather conditions in Cape Town initially prevented the cable repair ship from departing to fix the breaks. Once conditions improved, however, the ship was given permission to set sail from Cape Town harbour last night. The ship – called the Leon Thevenin – will take several days to reach the first repair site, though, and even more time to reach the second repair site. Openserve said it is expected to reach the first repair site on the WACS/SAT3 cable on Tuesday evening (28 January), unless weather conditions cause further delays. After this cable break has been repaired it will start its journey to the second cable break – which will once again take several days. Users can track the journey of the Leon Thevenin on the Marine Traffic website. <img class="aligncenter wp-image-336108" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Cable-repair-ship-tracking.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="448" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Cable-repair-ship-tracking.jpg 878w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Cable-repair-ship-tracking-571x400.jpg 571w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Cable-repair-ship-tracking-614x430.jpg 614w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Cable-repair-ship-tracking-768x538.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" />
