Lenovo has unveiled more details about its world-first foldable PC, the ThinkPad X1 Fold, at CES 2020. “Creating the world’s first foldable PC is a major engineering challenge, but Lenovo is more than up to the task,” said Lenovo Commercial PC and Smart Device Business president Christian Teismann. “Our legendary ThinkPad heritage has given us the foundation for progressive design over the years to now build an engineering masterpiece with X1 Fold, a new category of device that comes along once in a decade.” The X1 Fold can be partially unfolded so that users can use two displays simultaneously – such as when comparing documents or taking notes during a video presentation. When partially unfolded, the ThinkPad X1 Fold can also be used in landscape orientation to allow users to read e-books in a similar form factor to a traditional book. If the user unfolds the X1 Fold completely, the device’s 13.3-inch display can be used in conjunction with the Bluetooth Mini Fold Keyboard to function as a fully-fledged laptop. This keyboard is stored internally and is charged wirelessly when the device is folded into its tablet form. The unfolded device can also be connected to a full-sized keyboard and mouse, as well as to a second display via USB Type-C, to offer a traditional office experience. The X1 Fold is powered by Intel processors and the company’s Hybrid Technology. It will also be available with optional 5G connectivity. The device will initially run with Windows 10 when it becomes available in mid-2020, but Lenovo also plans on offering the device with Windows 10X in the future.
