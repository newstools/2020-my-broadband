Samsung announced its latest external storage drive at CES 2020 – the Portable T7 Touch SSD. The new drive uses the 10Gbps USB 3.2 Gen 2 standard, boasting the fastest portable SSD transfer speeds currently available. “With a read speed of 1,050MB/s and a write speed of 1,000MB/s, it is approximately twice as fast as its predecessor, the T5, and up to 9.5 times faster than external HDDs,” Samsung stated. This maximum speed can be achieved when used with the NVMe interface. Samsung offers the drive in capacities of 500GB, 1TB, and 2TB. It connects via a USB Type-C port and includes both a USB Type-C-to-C and USB Type-C-to-A cable for easy connectivity. To keep your data secure, the T7 Touch comes with several layers of security – most notably a built-in fingerprint sensor. It also features password protection and AES 256-bit hardware encryption. The drive is contained in a lightweight, solid aluminium casing that sports either a black or silver finish. The T7 Touch 500GB model will be priced at $129.99 (R1,840), while the 1TB option will cost $229.99 (R3,260) and the 2TB drive will set you back $399.99 (R5,670). Samsung did not specify if South Africa is included in the more than 30 countries in which the T7 Touch will be launched this month. A version of the T7 without the fingerprint reader will be released in Q2 2020.
