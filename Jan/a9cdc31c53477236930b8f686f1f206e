Huawei has confirmed that it still wants to use Google services should the US government lift its trade ban on the company. This follows previous claims by a Huawei executive that the company had no plans to use Google services – regardless of whether the ban was lifted. “Our first choice is the open Android ecosystem, including GMS (Google Mobile Services) — that was what helped us become number two in the world for smartphone shipments,” a Huawei spokesperson told The Verge. Huawei is currently able to use the open-source version of Android’s operating system but is unable to implement any Google services. The company is currently attempting to circumvent this by working on its own version of Google Mobile Services. “As a result of the entity listing, we are now developing HMS (Huawei Mobile Services) — inviting app developers to come on board. etc. This offer has received a lot of positive interest in Europe.” The United States’ campaign against Huawei has been less successful in the carrier space, despite continued efforts to block the Chinese company from western networks. Both the EU and the UK have decided against a blanket ban on Huawei network equipment being used in networks within these regions. “This evidence-based decision will result in a more advanced, more secure, and more cost-effective telecoms infrastructure that is fit for the future,” said Huawei VP Victor Zhang.
