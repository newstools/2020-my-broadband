Energy expert and EE Business Intelligence MD Chris Yelland has stated that the outlook for load-shedding in February, March, and April “looks bleak”. Yelland made the statement on Twitter, referencing electricity demand and production forecasts for the months ahead. “Lots of orange and red. Meaning Eskom running its emergency generation reserves (OCGTs and pumped storage) hard and at high cost, with likelihood of load-shedding,” said Yelland. Yelland recently stated that South African consumers and businesses have to take control of their own energy future – as they cannot rely on the government and Eskom. Over the past year, South Africans had to deal with regular power blackouts, with load-shedding hitting a historic high of stage 6 at the end of 2019. He added that the solution to South Africa’s electricity crisis is not going to come from the government, as it cannot deliver projects that can provide new electricity within the next one to two years. The statement from Yelland follows Eskom announcing that stage 2 load-shedding will be implemented this weekend. Eskom said load-shedding will start at 09:00 today and last throughout the weekend. The load-shedding will only stop at 06:00 on Monday morning (3 February). The company said the power cuts were due to a shortage of capacity and the depletion of emergency resources. “In addition, we are taking out three big units for planned maintenance today,” said Eskom. Unplanned outages were also at 12,722MW this morning, it added. Yelland’s tweet, which contains the forecasts for the next three months, is posted below.
