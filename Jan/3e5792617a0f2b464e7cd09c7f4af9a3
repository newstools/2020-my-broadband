Cable.co.uk has released its third global broadband price comparison, where South Africa was ranked 101 out of 206 countries on the average price of broadband. The report found that the average price of fixed-line broadband services in South Africa has come down by R135 per month – from R782 in September 2018 to R647 in December 2019. South Africa’s average price-to-speed also improved significantly – from R49.42 per Mbps to R32.38 per Mbps. While South Africa slipped 8 places down the rankings compared to the previous report, the 2020 results included 11 additional countries. To calculate its average price for South Africa, Cable.co.uk measured the prices of 35 fixed-line broadband packages. The cheapest package for its 2020 report was R99 per month and the most expensive was R2,499 per month. In total, Cable.co.uk recorded and compiled 3,095 fixed-line broadband deals across the 206 countries that it measured between 28 November 2019 and 8 January 2020. Sub-Saharan Africa fared worst overall, with all but six of the 35 countries in the region sitting in the most expensive half of the table. Eswatini (Swaziland) was the cheapest in the region, coming in 34th overall – with a converted average package price of R314 ($21.73 US). Meanwhile, Eritrea charges residential users an average of R38,530 ($2,666) per month for fixed-line broadband, and is the most expensive in the world. Equatorial Guinea (R3,748), Burundi (R4,100), and Mauritania (R10,038) join Eritrea as the most expensive countries in the region, and all sit among the 10 most expensive countries in the world. <span data-mce-type="bookmark" style="display: inline-block; width: 0px; overflow: hidden; line-height: 0;" class="mce_SELRES_start">﻿</span><span data-mce-type="bookmark" style="display: inline-block; width: 0px; overflow: hidden; line-height: 0;" class="mce_SELRES_start">﻿</span><span data-mce-type="bookmark" style="display: inline-block; width: 0px; overflow: hidden; line-height: 0;" class="mce_SELRES_start">﻿</span> There are four ways in which to sort Cable.co.uk’s data, each answering a different question: by average price, by cheapest package, by most expensive package, and by average price per Mbps. Cable.co.uk then converts each country’s local currency to US dollars and does not take into account purchasing power or average earnings in the countries ranked. South Africa’s ranking for each of the dimensions mentioned above is as follows (out of 206 countries). When looking at the average fixed-line broadband price rankings, South Africa outperforms Kenya, Ghana, Australia, the United States, and New Zealand. The picture changes slightly for the rankings of the average price per Mbps. South Africa does not rank better than the US, Australia, or New Zealand when looking at the price per Mbps. However, it does outperform Kenya, Nigeria, Ghana, Japan, and Denmark.
