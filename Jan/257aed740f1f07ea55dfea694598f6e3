MTN has announced that it will reduce the time period within which contract holders can use inclusive Night Express data. Previously, users were allowed to use this data from 00:01 until 05:59. However, MTN has now reduced this validity period to 00:01 until 04:59. The change will take effect from 2 March 2020, and MTN has begun notifying customers of the change via the following SMS: “Y’ello! Please note that from 2 March 2020, the expiry time on the Night Express data on your MTN Contract will change from 00:01 – 05:59am to 00:01 – 04:59am.

This brings the inclusive data version of Night Express in line with MTN’s dedicated Night Express bundles, said O’Sullivan. MTN previously adjusted the period during which standard Night Express bundles could be used in November 2019, with both contract and prepaid customers affected. “MTN adjusted the time expiry/validity of all Night Express bundles on the 26th of November 2019, for both Prepaid and Post- paid customers that have purchased Night Express bundles and promotional Night Express Bundles,” O’Sullivan explained. MTN has updated the Terms and Conditions of its Made for Me contracts to reflect the change. “The MTN Made For Me Plans will have inclusive data (Anytime and Night Express between 00:01-04:59), Voice minutes (MTN to all network minutes) and SMS included,” the terms and conditions state. “Data giveback e.g. Night Express (between 00:01-04:59) will not be allowed on the MTN Made For Me Plans inclusive contract value.” MTN has made several changes to its mobile offering recently, including the launch of its Mobile Money product earlier this week. Mobile Money allows users to make transactions – including the purchasing of airtime – without a bank account. Instead, Mobile Money customers can use their mobile device through the Mobile Money app or via USSD. There are two accounts to choose from – the Yello account, and the Yello Plus account. Yello allows for daily cash transactions limited to R3,500, total transactions limited to R10,000 per day, and a monthly limit of R20,000. Yello Plus supports daily cash transactions of up to R10,000, total transactions limited to R20,000, and a monthly limit of R40,000. Users can cash in or cash out funds at MTN-branded stores, UBank branches, or via EFT.
