Microsoft has announced that it will change its policy on upgrade blocks for Windows 10, Softpedia News reports. The new approach will help the company identify compatibility issues with the user’s devices before allowing their systems to receive a feature update. Upgrade blocks are a safety hold which is placed on a Windows 10 feature update once software or hardware bugs have been identified. As it stands, Microsoft is only able to issue an upgrade block after the first wave of the rollout, when glitches related to certain devices are discovered. In new guidance to hardware partners, the company said it will now let them submit requests for upgrade blocks in the event that they discover bugs or compatibility problems with their devices. Once an upgrade block is set, the partner will have a maximum of 60 days to resolve the issue and post an updated driver. Microsoft said the problems must directly influence the OS following the update. Glitches could include driver crashes, BSODs, security bugs, connectivity issues, and loss of data. This follows after Windows 10 experienced a flurry of bugs related to updates in the few last months of 2019. The next Windows 10 feature update – version 2004 –  is expected to roll out in March 2020.
