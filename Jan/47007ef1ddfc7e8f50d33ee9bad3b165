MTN announced today that it will migrate customers to a new service platform with several enhancements and new features. The process will be carried out in three phases, with the first batch of MTN contract customers being migrated on 28 January. According to MTN, the new platform boasts an updated invoice layout and password protection. Additionally, customers will get access to simplified customer processes, quicker authentication, and a better vetting response time. The operator plans to add enhanced customer communication, as well as real-time reconnection features and improved tracking for customer queries. MTN South Africa’s Executive of Corporate Affairs Jacqui O’Sullivan said that the company is performing the migration as a way to improve service and customer experience. “We look forward to the promise of this new platform as we gear up to better serve our customers,” O’Sullivan said. MTN said that customers will be notified two hours prior to the start of their migration. Once the process begins, it is expected to last no longer than 16 hours until completion. However, during this period, certain services like airtime and data recharges could be temporarily affected. “We apologise to our customers for any inconvenience caused during the migration period however we have taken steps to ensure that the impact is minimal and that our teams are on standby to assist customers,” O’Sullivan said. If customers require assistance on the day of their migration, they can contact MTN’s call centre on 135. Migration-related calls will be sent to a dedicated team of agents for quick resolution. The complete migration is expected to take three months.
