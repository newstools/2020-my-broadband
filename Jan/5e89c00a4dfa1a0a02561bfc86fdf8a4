Google is working on a new notification permission interface which will crack down on annoying website notification permission requests. “Immediately after the Chrome 80 release, users will be able to opt-in to the new UI manually in Settings,” said Google in a blog post. Through the Settings menu, users will be able to enable the new prompts manually or disable the feature completely. To enable the feature, users must navigate to “Sites can ask to send notifications” in: In addition, the quieter UI will be automatically enabled for users under two conditions: “The automated enrollment will be enabled gradually after the release while we gather user and developer feedback,” Google added. Google said it plans to implement additional measures later in 2020 that will punish websites which abuse web notifications for advertising, malware, or other deceptive purposes. The company also recommended that web developers test their websites to ensure that the quieter UI works. “We recommend that web developers test their site’s permission request flow with the quieter notification permission UI, by enabling it manually in chrome://settings/content/notifications,” said Google. “The feature is being rolled out gradually to Canary, Dev, and Beta channels, and can be force-enabled in chrome://flags/#quiet-notification-prompts in Chrome 80 and later.”
