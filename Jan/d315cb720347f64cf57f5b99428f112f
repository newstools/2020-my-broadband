GMC is set to reveal an all-electric Hummer on 20 May 2020. The company teased the new vehicle on its website, where it shared details on the performance of the truck. The Hummer electric vehicle (EV) will boast up to 1,000 horsepower, with a torque of 15,500 Nm, delivering acceleration of 0-100 km/h in 3 seconds. GMC did not reveal information about the EV’s maximum range or battery size, however, which could be key factors for potential buyers. A disclaimer on the web page indicated that the Hummer EV is expected to be rolled out in 2021 in the US, just in time to put it head-to-head with Tesla’s upcoming Cybertruck. GMC is reputed for making large, robust vehicles which generally aren’t considered to be environmentally-friendly. In 1992 it released the first Hummer – the H1 – as a civilian version of the military Humvee. That vehicle, and its successors – the H2 and H3 – have been slammed for being extremely fuel-heavy. The Hummer H2, for example, has consumption figures of 26L/100km (under 4km per litre). Additionally, despite its impressive V8 engine, performance is dragged down by the H2’s immense weight. The Hummer brand was discontinued in 2010, owing to a plummet in sales driven by higher fuel prices. <span data-mce-type="bookmark" style="display: inline-block; width: 0px; overflow: hidden; line-height: 0;" class="mce_SELRES_start">﻿</span>
