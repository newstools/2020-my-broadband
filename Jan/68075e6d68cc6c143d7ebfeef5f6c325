Intel has stated that its new 10th-generation mobile processors will boast clock speeds of more than 5GHz, according to a report by Engadget. The H-series CPUs will be available in gaming laptops later this year. According to Intel, the new Core i7 clock will top 5GHz, making it faster than the chipmaker’s current flagship Core i9-9980HK, which has a maximum speed of 5GHz. The new Core i9 will reportedly be even faster than this Core i7. The announcement came as part of a “sneak peek” before Intel’s keynote at CES 2020. <img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-334158" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/960x0-640x213.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="213" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/960x0-640x213.jpg 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/960x0-600x199.jpg 600w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/960x0-768x255.jpg 768w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/960x0.jpg 960w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> Intel’s biggest rival, AMD, unveiled several impressive processors in 2019. It has made significant gains in processor market share with its Ryzen 3000 series, and PassMark recently revealed that 40% of users running its software were using an AMD processor. Those numbers may have been higher, had it not been for AMD’s supply issues. AMD processors are generally more affordable and have the advantage of higher core counts and more threads. Intel only unveiled its first 10nm mobile processors late in 2019 and will launch 10nm desktop chips this year, where AMD has already released several processors that are based on its 7nm process. Intel still dominates the mobile CPU market, however, partly due to the absence of AMD’s 7nm Zen 2 Ryzen processors as well as its superior single-thread performance.
