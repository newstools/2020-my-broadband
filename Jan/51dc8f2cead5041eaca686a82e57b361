The WannaCry virus was the most prevalent of all ransomware attacks in 2019, according to Precise Security. The report said that WannaCry was encountered by 23.56% of all encryption ransomware victims last year. “Most of the computer users became victims of the WannaCry virus because of not updating their Microsoft Windows,” said Precise Security. “Therefore, updating software and operating system regularly is an essential ransomware protection step.” Precise Security said that WannaCry affected a total of 230,000 victims globally and caused losses of about $4 billion. Other popular encryption ransomware includes Trojan-Ransom.Win32.Phny, Trojan-Ransom.Win32.Gen, and GranCrab. Precise Security’s data showed that spam emails remain the dominant means of infecting computers with ransomware, with 67% of all Managed Service Provider (MSP) users reporting ransomware attacks caused by spam and phishing emails. Precise Security said that ransomware is becoming a bigger problem across a large variety of sectors. “The number of ransomware attacks against government agencies, organizations in the healthcare, energy sectors, and education continues to rise.” “While some simple ransomware may lock the system in a way that is not difficult for a knowledgeable person to reverse, more advanced malware exploits a technique called crypto-viral extortion.” This technique makes it significantly more difficult for users to regain their information without paying the malicious parties.
