Eskom has implemented extended stage 2 load-shedding, the company announced this morning. Stage 2 load-shedding will run from 08:00 today, 9 January, to 06:00 tomorrow morning, 10 January. “The system remains severely constrained and unpredictable, and as such load-shedding stage 2 will unfortunately have to continue,” said Eskom. “We have lost additional generation capacity overnight with breakdowns of over 14,000MW.” This follows Eskom implementing stage 2 load-shedding from 21:00 last night until 08:00 this morning. Eskom said its teams “continue to work tirelessly to return units back from planned and unplanned outages”. “Owing to inadequate maintenance over a number of years, the system remains vulnerable to unplanned power outages,” said Eskom. Energy advisor Ted Blom has stated that Eskom should create 5,000MW of space on the grid and use this additional capacity to take generating units offline and do proper maintenance on power plants. He said the full fleet of Eskom’s old power stations needed proper maintenance and refurbishment, which will take between three and four years. A possible avenue to accomplish this is through power barges – also known as powerships – or similar programmes. Powerships are cost-effective, privately owned and operated floating power stations which can be moored at South African harbours. @POWERALERT 1
