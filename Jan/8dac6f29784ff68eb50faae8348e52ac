2019 saw a number of highly-successful games launch. However, 2020 may be even better – as a number of big titles and iterations of popular franchises are set to be released. The most anticipated video games expected to launch in 2020 are listed below. <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-316877" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Cyberpunk-2077-header.jpg" alt="Cyberpunk 2077 header" width="640" height="430" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Cyberpunk-2077-header.jpg 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Cyberpunk-2077-header-300x202.jpg 300w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Cyberpunk-2077-header-595x400.jpg 595w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> Cyberpunk 2077 is one of the most exciting games to be unveiled in recent years. Made by CD Projekt Red, which is known for smash hit The Witcher 3, Cyberpunk 2077 is expected to have a much larger open world, yet will allegedly be just as packed with stories and characters as The Witcher 3. Cyberpunk 2077 is expected to launch on 16 April 2020. <img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-331802" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Ori-and-the-Will-of-the-Wisps-640x430.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="430" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Ori-and-the-Will-of-the-Wisps-640x430.jpg 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Ori-and-the-Will-of-the-Wisps-595x400.jpg 595w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Ori-and-the-Will-of-the-Wisps-300x202.jpg 300w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Ori-and-the-Will-of-the-Wisps-768x516.jpg 768w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Ori-and-the-Will-of-the-Wisps-1536x1032.jpg 1536w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Ori-and-the-Will-of-the-Wisps-2048x1376.jpg 2048w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Ori-and-the-Will-of-the-Wisps-1200x806.jpg 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> Ori and the Will of the Wisps is a sequel to the hugely popular Ori and the Blind Forest. The game is expected to be of a similar style to the previous iteration, but with even more vibrant graphics. Developed by Moon Studios, the game is set to launch on 11 February 2020. <img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-331798" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Last-of-US-Part-2-640x430.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="430" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Last-of-US-Part-2-640x430.jpg 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Last-of-US-Part-2-595x400.jpg 595w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Last-of-US-Part-2-300x202.jpg 300w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Last-of-US-Part-2-768x516.jpg 768w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Last-of-US-Part-2-1536x1032.jpg 1536w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Last-of-US-Part-2-1200x806.jpg 1200w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Last-of-US-Part-2.jpg 2000w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> The sequel to the popular The Last of Us game, The Last of Us Part 2 is expected to offer an even more brutal and emotional experience. The game will improve upon the original’s combat style, while several new characters will also be introduced. The Last of Us Part 2 is set to launch on 29 May 2020. <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-201020" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Avatar.jpg" alt="Avatar" width="640" height="430" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Avatar.jpg 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Avatar-300x202.jpg 300w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Avatar-595x400.jpg 595w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> Based on the James Cameron movie, the Avatar game will use Ubisoft’s Snowdrop Engine – which powers The Division. The game is expected to be an open-world adventure game, and will take place in Pandora, the same land in which the movie took place. It is likely that the game will launch at a similar time to the 18 December 2020 release date of the Avatar 2 movie. <img class="size-full wp-image-166048 aligncenter" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Blizzard-Overwatch.jpg" alt="Blizzard Overwatch" width="600" height="400" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Blizzard-Overwatch.jpg 600w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Blizzard-Overwatch-250x166.jpg 250w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> Popular online shooter Overwatch is set to get a revamp in the form of Overwatch 2. Blizzard will add four-player co-op missions that focus on telling stories, as opposed to the current online, arena-focused gameplay that Overwatch is known for. This will allow players to engage more deeply in the lore of the various characters. The game will also include new maps, heroes, and game modes for the PvP version of the game. It is unclear when Overwatch 2 will be launched, but it is expected to take place in 2020. <img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-331796" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/diablo-4-640x430.jpg" alt="diablo 4" width="640" height="430" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/diablo-4-640x430.jpg 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/diablo-4-596x400.jpg 596w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/diablo-4-300x202.jpg 300w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/diablo-4-768x516.jpg 768w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/diablo-4.jpg 938w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> Blizzard is expected to launch Diablo 4 in 2020. The next iteration from this popular franchise will lose the cartoonish style that is present in Diablo 3. Instead, it will sport a grungier style similar to that in older versions of the game. Diablo 4 will also include popular classes that were not available in Diablo 3 – such as the Sorceress – and will now take place in a shared open world. Users will be able to group up, play solo, or engage in PvP battles.
