The Road Traffic Management Corporation is warning South Africans about a new WhatsApp car licence renewal service called ChatBack. ChatBack was launched last year and makes it possible for South Africans to renew their car licence through a few simple steps on WhatsApp. ChatBack CEO Johan Kotze said the whole process takes only a few minutes and customers can expect their new licence disk to be delivered within five days. The ChatBack websites lists the four steps to renew your vehicle licence as follows: ChatBack added that it will also send customers a reminder when their vehicle licence is up for renewal the following year. Road Traffic Management Corporation spokesperson Simon Zwane has warned that the service has not been sanctioned by the organisation, however. He said their concern is that vehicle owners will give their personal details to a third party – which carries risks. Zwane said they have often seen criminals using the personal details of motorists to conduct fraudulent transactions. “You provide an unknown person your name, ID number, and details of your car,” he said. This can make you a target for hijackings or other crimes. He said these details can also be used to clone a car, which means the rightful owner can be held liable for offences committed by the cloned vehicle. <span data-mce-type="bookmark" style="display: inline-block; width: 0px; overflow: hidden; line-height: 0;" class="mce_SELRES_start">﻿</span>
