MyBroadband has released its Q4 2019 speed test report, which shows that Supersonic and Cybersmart are the best Internet Service Providers (ISPs) in South Africa. MyBroadband’s Q4 2019 speed test report is based on 34,799 user ratings through MyBroadband’s web-based speed test and its Android and iOS speed test apps. After users performed a speed test, they rated their ISP based on their overall satisfaction with their provider. These customer satisfaction ratings are then used to rank South Africa’s prominent ISPs. MyBroadband’s speed test servers are hosted in Teraco’s vendor-neutral data centres to ensure a neutral testing environment. MyBroadband has speed test servers at NAPAfrica’s peering points in Johannesburg, Cape Town, and Durban. Through NAPAfrica, all network operators present at its peering points are provided with a free 10Gbps connection to the MyBroadband speed test platform. This testing platform means that there is an equal playing field which accurately measures Internet speed, rather than on-net speed which is the case with other speed test services. The table below ranks South Africa’s prominent ISPs based on the average ratings received through MyBroadband’s web-based speed test and mobile app. Supersonic and Cybersmart retained their positions from the Q4 results, with Cool Ideas falling below some of its main competitors. Telkom remained at the bottom of the rankings.
