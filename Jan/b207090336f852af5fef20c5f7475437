Three products were able to obtain the maximum score in AV-TEST’s latest antivirus product tests for December 2019. BullGuard Internet Security, Kaspersky Internet Security, and NortonLifeLock Norton Security all scored 18/18 in the tests, attaining full marks for protection, performance, and usability. Several other popular antivirus programmes were just half a point off the top spot – including AVG, Avast, and Windows Defender. AV-TEST said that it continuously evaluated each of these products by using their default settings. “We always used the most current publicly-available version of all products for the testing,” said AV-TEST. “They were allowed to update themselves at any time and query their in-the-cloud services.” “We focused on realistic test scenarios and challenged the products against real-world threats. Products had to demonstrate their capabilities using all components and protection layers.” View the results of the testing below. <img class="aligncenter wp-image-336644" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/AV-Test-anti-virus-results-529x430.jpg" alt="AV-Test anti virus results" width="640" height="520" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/AV-Test-anti-virus-results-529x430.jpg 529w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/AV-Test-anti-virus-results-492x400.jpg 492w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/AV-Test-anti-virus-results-768x624.jpg 768w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/AV-Test-anti-virus-results-1536x1248.jpg 1536w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/AV-Test-anti-virus-results-1200x975.jpg 1200w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/AV-Test-anti-virus-results.jpg 2000w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> Despite the software scoring almost full marks in the tests, both Vice and PCMag have cautioned users about the alleged practices of Avast. According to these reports, Avast tracks the behaviour of its users and sells their private data to other companies through a subsidiary called Jumpshot. Vice and PCMag claim to have obtained Jumpshot data that details users’ web histories – including Google searches, location searches, watched YouTube videos, and even interactions on porn websites. In response, Avast published the following statement: “Because of our approach, we ensure that Jumpshot does not acquire personal identification information, including name, email address or contact details, from people using our popular free antivirus software.”
