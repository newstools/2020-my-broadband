The Department of Public Enterprises announced that it has appointed Professor Malegapuru Makgoba as interim chair of the Eskom board. This follows after previous board chairman Jabu Mabuza resigned from the position at the power utility. Professor Makgoba is described by the department as a “leading scientist and academic” who joined the Eskom board as a non-executive director in 2018. “His appointment as interim chair is consistent with the government’s commitment to good governance and the stability of the company,” the department said. “The government is going through the process of putting in place a reconfigured board in line with President Cyril Ramaphosa’s announcement on Friday 10 January.” President Ramaphosa announced that the government would introduce an overhauled Eskom board with an appropriate mix of electricity industry, engineering, and corporate governance experience. Ex-Eskom chair Jabu Mabuza’s resignation was preceded by a period of consistent load-shedding, despite the President’s promise that no load-shedding would take place. The office of President Cyril Ramaphosa said Mabuza wrote a letter as part of his resignation announcement, in which he apologised for Eskom’s inability to meet the commitment it made to the President to avoid load-shedding from 11 December 2019 to 13 January 2020. “Public Enterprises Minister Pravin Gordhan has accepted Mr Mabuza’s resignation,” Ramaphosa’s office said. “President Ramaphosa has expressed his gratitude to Mr Mabuza for serving Eskom and the nation during a challenging period and has commended Mr Mabuza for taking responsibility and accepting accountability for events under his leadership.” Mabuza was described as a “safe pair of hands” by Raymond Parsons, a professor at North-West University’s Business School in Potchefstroom, at the time – and the move was called a “positive development”.
