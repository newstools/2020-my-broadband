Data analytics company NPD has released a report outlining the state of the gaming market at the end of 2019. “The report provides both online and retail sales results for new physical video game products, as well as a subset of full-game digital downloads from participating publishers in NPD’s digital panel. It is not intended to cover total market/total consumer spend,” said NPD. Video game hardware, software, accessory, and game card sales tracked by NPD for December 2019 totalled $3 billion. This represents a 15% drop when compared to the same period last year. Tracked spending for all of 2019 also declined by 13% compared to 2018 and totalled $14.6 billion. NPD’s data showed Call of Duty: Modern Warfare was the best-selling game of 2019, making it the 11th consecutive year that Call of Duty was the best-selling franchise. The franchise also boasts 10 of the top 15 best-selling games of the 2010s. Despite only launching two months before the end of 2019, Star Wars: Jedi Fallen Order is already Respawn Entertainment’s best-selling game of all time and finished 2019 as the year’s sixth best-selling title. The top 10 best-selling games of the 2010s can be found below.
