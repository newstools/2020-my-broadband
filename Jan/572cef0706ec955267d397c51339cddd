Electricity blackouts recently made an unwelcome return to South Africa after Eskom announced stage 2 load-shedding this past weekend. Load-shedding is highly disruptive to citizens and costs the struggling South African economy billions. According to economists at the Efficient Group, load-shedding cost the country R8.5 billion of real, inflation-adjusted rands in 2019. Eskomâ€™s advice to citizens includes investing in gas lamps, using solar-powered security lights, and keeping boiled water in a thermos flask during power outages. This, however, shifts the responsibility to alleviate the impact of load-shedding from those responsible to those who can do nothing about it. Politicians have created an Eskom monopoly which has been gutted by corruption, looting, and mismanagement. As South African citizens do not have the option of an alternative electricity supplier, it should be the responsibility of the politicians who created this problem to help citizens during load-shedding. Economist Mike Schussler has provided a list of things politicians and councillors should do regarding load-shedding if they really cared for honest, hardworking citizens. <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-334054" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Traffic-light.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="429" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Traffic-light.jpg 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Traffic-light-597x400.jpg 597w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Traffic-light-300x202.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-300932" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Solar-Panel-CSIR-dual.png" alt="" width="640" height="427" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Solar-Panel-CSIR-dual.png 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Solar-Panel-CSIR-dual-600x400.png 600w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-334056" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Gas-flame.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="430" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Gas-flame.jpg 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Gas-flame-595x400.jpg 595w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Gas-flame-300x202.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> <img class="aligncenter wp-image-116864" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Illegal-electricity-connections-in-Cape-Town-near-Phillipi1.jpg" alt="Illegal electricity connections in Cape Town near Phillipi" width="640" height="427" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Illegal-electricity-connections-in-Cape-Town-near-Phillipi1.jpg 600w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Illegal-electricity-connections-in-Cape-Town-near-Phillipi1-250x166.jpg 250w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-147993" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Eskom-logo-load-shedding.jpg" alt="Eskom logo load shedding" width="640" height="430" /> <img class="aligncenter wp-image-123578" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Salary1.jpg" alt="Salary" width="640" height="427" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Salary1.jpg 600w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Salary1-250x166.jpg 250w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-300024" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Eskom-logo-neon-light.jpg" alt="Eskom logo neon light" width="640" height="430" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Eskom-logo-neon-light.jpg 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Eskom-logo-neon-light-300x202.jpg 300w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Eskom-logo-neon-light-595x400.jpg 595w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> <img class="aligncenter wp-image-91925" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/Jail-Cell-Door-Lock-Key.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="427" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/Jail-Cell-Door-Lock-Key.jpg 600w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/Jail-Cell-Door-Lock-Key-250x166.jpg 250w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" />
