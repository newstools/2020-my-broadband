The weBoost Drive AM100-pro is a powerful, first-of-its-kind wide-band vehicle cell phone signal booster and has just launched in South Africa, designed to provide strong cellular connectivity in cars, trucks, caravans and boats. Compatible with all cellular phones and all major network providers in South Africa, it allows users to enjoy seamless cellular reception, fewer dropped calls and faster data upload/download speeds while on the go. There are no monthly fees nor does it need to be connected to any internet source to work. It simply amplifies your existing in-vehicle cellular service up to awa 32X for better voice, text, and faster internet. The weBoost Drive AM100-pro boasts output power capabilities of up to 50 dB gain – allowing it to boost signal strength in locations further away from cell signal towers, and greatly enhancing 2G, 3G and 4G LTE cell service. Whether you’re traveling for work or leisure, a strong cellular signal is essential for both productivity and safety reasons. Thanks to the weBoost Drive AM100-pro’s powerful amplifying abilities, users will see a huge improvement in their cellular connectivity and speed across all cellular service providers, providing peace of mind wherever the road takes you. The weBoost Drive AM100-pro is an easy to install plug-and-play system and comes as a complete kit with all parts included. The weBoost Drive AM100-Pro Kit includes: <img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-336454" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/WeBoost-Vehicle-Image-640x229.jpg" alt="WeBoost Vehicle Image" width="640" height="229" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/WeBoost-Vehicle-Image-640x229.jpg 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/WeBoost-Vehicle-Image-600x214.jpg 600w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/WeBoost-Vehicle-Image-768x275.jpg 768w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/WeBoost-Vehicle-Image.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> The three main causes of poor cellular reception in a vehicle are cell tower distance, outside interference, and car materials (ie. tinted windows). It is especially true of car materials in city & urban areas and of cell tower distance in rural areas. A weBoost AM100-Pro cell phone signal booster solves all three problems by reaching further distances to and from the cell tower with its powerful antenna, brings in signal from outside, bypassing any vehicle material interference and broadcasts the amplified signal inside the vehicle. We tested the AM100-Pro in a car with a sunroof (more prone to oscillation), so a great way to put the unit through its paces. We placed the outside mini magnet antenna next to the car’s own antenna. The inside antenna was placed next to the gear lever inside. The cell phone was held 1 meter away from the inside panel antenna. Driving around Johannesburg, we tested the vehicle signal booster at various locations by switching the signal booster on and off and noting the difference in cell signal strength readings. <img class="aligncenter wp-image-336456" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/CarTest1-484x430.png" alt="CarTest1" width="640" height="568" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/CarTest1-484x430.png 484w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/CarTest1-450x400.png 450w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/CarTest1.png 750w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> <img class="aligncenter wp-image-336458" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/CarTest2-587x430.png" alt="CarTest2" width="640" height="469" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/CarTest2-587x430.png 587w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/CarTest2-546x400.png 546w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/CarTest2-768x563.png 768w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/CarTest2.png 970w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> Signal strength is measured in decibel-milliwatts. Typically, a strong outside signal would be somewhere around -50 to -70 dBm, while anything below -100 dBm would be considered weak (-120 means no signal at all). According to the logarithm, the signal strength doubles with every third decibel, meaning that a dBm signal strength of something like -70 is actually twice the power of -73 dBm. The numbers may not make it look like a great change has occurred, but in reality, the decibels have grown exponentially. <img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-336460" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Poynting-Results-Table-640x260.png" alt="Poynting Results-Table" width="640" height="260" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Poynting-Results-Table-640x260.png 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Poynting-Results-Table-600x243.png 600w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Poynting-Results-Table-768x312.png 768w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Poynting-Results-Table.png 986w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> All measurements were taken using “Network Cell Info Lite” – an Android App that provides you with your signal strength measurements and shows you where your nearest cell tower is located. <img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-336462" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Hilton-on-vs-Off-640x430.jpg" alt="Hilton on vs Off" width="640" height="430" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Hilton-on-vs-Off.jpg 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Hilton-on-vs-Off-595x400.jpg 595w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Hilton-on-vs-Off-300x202.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> <img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-336464" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Fredman-Off-vs-on-640x430.jpg" alt="Fredman Off vs on" width="640" height="430" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Fredman-Off-vs-on.jpg 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Fredman-Off-vs-on-595x400.jpg 595w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Fredman-Off-vs-on-300x202.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> <img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-336466" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Mandela-off-vs-on-640x430.jpg" alt="Mandela off vs on" width="640" height="430" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Mandela-off-vs-on-640x430.jpg 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Mandela-off-vs-on-595x400.jpg 595w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Mandela-off-vs-on-300x202.jpg 300w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Mandela-off-vs-on-768x516.jpg 768w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Mandela-off-vs-on-1200x806.jpg 1200w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Mandela-off-vs-on.jpg 1500w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> <img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-336468" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Cricket-off-vs-on-640x430.jpg" alt="Cricket off vs on" width="640" height="430" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Cricket-off-vs-on.jpg 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Cricket-off-vs-on-595x400.jpg 595w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Cricket-off-vs-on-300x202.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> The weBoost AM100-Pro is approved by ICASA and available for purchase now online at www.boltontechnical.co.za or through authorized reseller IntetoConnect (previously PoyntingDirect) who can be contacted at info@poynting.tech or +27 12 657 0050.
