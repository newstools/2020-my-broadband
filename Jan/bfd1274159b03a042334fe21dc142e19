AMD unveiled its new Ryzen Threadripper 3990X alongside a new lineup of Ryzen 4000 chips at CES 2020. The Ryzen Threadripper 3990X boasts 64 physical cores and 128 threads and will be available globally from 7 February 2020. AMD said the Ryzen Threadripper 3990X is purpose-built for users who require extreme performance, delivering up to 51% faster rendering performance than the Ryzen Threadripper 3970X chip. “With an unprecedented amount of single-socket compute performance in a desktop platform, the AMD Ryzen Threadripper 3990X will be the definitive solution for digital content creation professionals working with 3D animation, raytraced VFX, and 8K video codecs,” the company said. The Ryzen Threadripper 3990X chip features base and boost clock speeds of 2.9GHz and 4.3GHz respectively, and draws 280W of power. AMD stated that the high-end desktop processor would be priced at $3,990. In addition to the Ryzen Threadripper 3990X, AMD also launched a new lineup of Ryzen 4000 and Athlon 3000 mobile processors for laptops. “We are kicking off 2020 with a bang, bringing unmatched performance, graphics, and longer battery life to ultrathin and gaming laptop users with the new AMD Ryzen 4000 Series Mobile Processors,” said AMD Client Compute senior vice president Saeid Moshkelani. “We saw historic portfolio growth for AMD Ryzen Mobile-powered systems in 2019, and we are already on track to bring wider system adoption of AMD Ryzen 4000 Series Mobile Processors in 2020 from major OEM partners, offering twice the power-efficiency from the previous generation.” These mobile processors boast up to 8 cores and 16 threads and are designed for ultrathin laptops with a configurable TDP of 15W. AMD said its top-of-the-range Ryzen 7 4800H laptop chip boasts up to 18% faster graphics performance and 46% better multi-threaded performance than the competition. The company’s Athlon 3000 Series chips are based on its Zen CPU architecture and offer greatly improved performance for lower-end notebooks. Systems with AMD Ryzen 4000 chips are set to roll out from global manufacturers in early 2020. Below are the specifications of AMD’s new Ryzen 4000 and Athlon 3000 mobile processors.
