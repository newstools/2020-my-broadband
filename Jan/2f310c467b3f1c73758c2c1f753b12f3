The Samsung S20+ will feature a quad-camera setup and large curved display, according to a report from XDA Developers. This was revealed in a new leak from Max Weinbach (@MaxWinebach), who received two images of the device from an anonymous source. An image of its startup screen reveals the device to be the Samsung Galaxy S20+ 5G. The images appear to confirm previous leaks which claimed that the device would feature a rectangular camera block with four sensors. These could be the rumoured 12MP 1.8-micron main sensor, as well as an ultra-wide, telephoto, and macro lens. Weinbach noted that the source said the Infinity-O display of the S20+ is less curved than the screen on the Galaxy S10+. Its punch-hole selfie camera has also been moved to the top centre part of the display. The Galaxy S20+ is set to be the mid-level entry in this yearâ€™s lineup, as reports indicate that the standard S20 will now be the entry-level model. A new Ultra variant will supposedly top off the range, boasting the biggest display and flagship camera configuration. Samsung is expected to launch both 4G and 5G versions of Galaxy S20 devices in various markets, with the smartphones set to be unveiled on 11 February. The leaked images from XDA Developers and Max Weinbach are shown below. <img class="aligncenter wp-image-334994 size-full" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Samsung-S20-leaked.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="600" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Samsung-S20-leaked.jpg 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Samsung-S20-leaked-427x400.jpg 427w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Samsung-S20-leaked-459x430.jpg 459w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" />
