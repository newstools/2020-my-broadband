Microsoft’s Surface Pro 8 two-in-one laptop could include an integrated solar panel for charging, according to a patent filed by the company. The invention is titled “Mobile device cover with integrated solar panel” and comprises layering the Surface Pro’s Type Cover with four small solar panel units. Placing the panels in this position allows for the use of the device while it charges. Users would be able to adjust the Type Cover at an optimal angle to the sun for the best possible charging efficiency. Microsoft said that the device will be capable of charging from both the sun and closely-located artificial sources of light. The company said that more solar panels of different kinds could be employed in the design. “Conversely, a larger number of solar panels can also be used, rather than the four panels shown,” the patent reads. “The solar panels can be any of a variety of solar panels, including monocrystalline solar panels, polycrystalline solar panels, thin-film amorphous silicon solar panels, and/or concentrated PV cell solar panels,” Microsoft added. The picture below shows the solar panel design outlined in Microsoft’s patent. <img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-335160" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Microsoft-Surface-Pro-wiht-solar-panel-patent-640x430.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="430" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Microsoft-Surface-Pro-wiht-solar-panel-patent.jpg 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Microsoft-Surface-Pro-wiht-solar-panel-patent-595x400.jpg 595w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Microsoft-Surface-Pro-wiht-solar-panel-patent-300x202.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" />
