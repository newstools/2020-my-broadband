Apple has launched a global replacement programme for faulty smart battery case units. These cases extend the battery life of the iPhone Xs and Xr devices by wirelessly charging them while attached. Users have reported issues with the cases either not being able to charge, charging intermittently when plugged into power, and not delivering power to their phone at all. “Apple has determined that some smart battery cases made for iPhone Xs, iPhone Xs Max, and iPhone Xr may experience charging issues,” the company said. The company assured customers that the cases posed no dangers to users and promised free replacements for qualifying units. “This is not a safety issue and Apple or an Apple Authorized Service Provider will replace eligible battery cases, free of charge.” The affected units were manufactured between January 2019 and October 2019, Apple said. To request a replacement, eligible iPhone owners must contact their nearest Apple Authorised Service Provider. In addition, users can contact Apple Support for further assistance. Apple noted that the programme does not extend the standard warranty of the cases and that the offer is valid for two years after the first sale of the battery case.
