Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE) South Africa has introduced a new parental leave policy for employees. As part of its “HPE Work That Fits Your Life” programme, employees can now receive 26 weeks of paid parental leave. “HPE employees in South Africa are now benefiting from the introduction of 26 weeks of paid leave for new parents – both mothers and fathers – as well as parental transition support, retirement transition support, and wellness Fridays,” said HPE. This will include “flexible working arrangements” in recognition of the importance of equal parenting. The parental leave policy applies to new parents with at least one year of HPE service. The 26 weeks of paid leave must also be taken within the first 12 months after the birth or adoption of a child, said the company. “HPE has also implemented parental transition support, which is a flexible work arrangement policy that offers new parents the opportunity to work part time for up to 36 months after the birth or adoption of a child.” Additionally, employees are encouraged to take “wellness Fridays”, which allows them to leave the office three hours early one Friday each month to volunteer, focus on physical or emotional health, or spend time on personal or career development. “At HPE in South Africa, we want all of our employees to be reaching their full potential in their careers. That means supporting them as they grow their families as well,” said President Ntuli, Managing Director of HPE South Africa.
