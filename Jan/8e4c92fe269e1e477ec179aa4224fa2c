The World Economic Forum Annual Meeting in Davos kicks off today, and several high-profile South African tech executives are attending the event. The annual event brings together 3,000 world leaders to discuss global, regional, and industry agendas at the beginning of each year. The World Economic Forum’s mission is to improve the state of the world, which has driven the design and development of the annual meeting objectives. This year there is a strong focus on sustainable development goals and the facilitation of discussions on technology and trade governance. The programme at the 2020 meeting prioritises six areas: Ecology, Economy, Technology, Society, Geopolitics, and Industry. “With the world at such critical crossroads, this year we must develop a ‘Davos Manifesto 2020’ to reimagine the purpose and scorecards for companies and governments,” said Professor Klaus Schwab, Founder and Executive Chairman at the World Economic Forum. “It is what the World Economic Forum was founded for 50 years ago, and it is what we want to contribute to for the next 50 years.” Attending the World Economic Forum in Davos is popular among government officials, world leaders, and high-profile business leaders. South Africa is no exception, with ministers, government officials, and business leaders among the list of 50 South Africans attending this year’s event. Ministers attending the event include finance minister Tito Mboweni, minister of health Zweli Mkhize, and international relations minister Naledi Pandor. Top business leaders at Davos include Nedbank CEO Mike Brown, Absa deputy CEO Peter Matlare, Investec CEO Fani Titi, and Standard Bank CEO Siphiwe Tshabalala. The full list of South African attendees to Davos 2020 is available here. There are seven business leaders in the South African telecommunications and technology market who are at Davos 2020. While Naspers CEO Bob van Dijk is neither a South African or based in South Africa, he is still listed as a South African delegate.
