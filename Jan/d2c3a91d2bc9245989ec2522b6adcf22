Minister of Basic Education Angie Motshekga will announce the outcome of the 2019 National Senior Certificate examinations on 7 January 2020. A total of 790,405 candidates sat for 147 question papers in 7,416 examination centres across South Africa. The exams were concluded on 28 November 2019 and the Department of Basic Education said it was pleased with the smooth conclusion of the 2019 National Senior Certificate examinations. “It is indeed gratifying that the 2019 National Senior Certificate examination went fairly smooth, with only a few, manageable incidents across our examination centres,” said Motshekga. While the minister will announce the matric results on 7 January 2020, individual results will only be available at schools on 8 January 2020. Candidates are urged to get their statements of results from their school or centre where they wrote the exams. Here are a few of the prominent places where learners who wrote the 2019 National Senior Certificate examinations can get their individual matric results. Candidates’ partial results will be made available on the Department of Basic Education website. News24 has partnered with the IEC (Electoral Commission) to bring South Africans the 2019 matric results. The EWN matric results portal makes it possible for learners to get their results online on the day of release. The Sowetan Live matric portal offers National Senior Certificate learners a pre-registration service to receive their results and share them on social media. The 2019 matric results will be published in most of South Africa’s major daily newspapers on 9 January 2019. To find their results, users will have to know their exam number (learners’ exam numbers will be published instead of their names). The Department of Basic Education urged learners to get their statements of results on 8 January 2020 from their school or centre where they wrote the exams. Learners can send their ID number and exam number to 35658 to register to receive their 2019 matric results. They will get a confirmation SMS after registration, and will then receive their results as soon as they become available. There is a once-off cost of R3.00 to register. On the day the results are released, users can dial *120*35658# and follow the instructions to receive their matric results. Users will receive their results per subject after they have completed the process. Learners can call the Department of Basic Education on 082 152 to receive their 2019 matric results. On 8 January 2020, learners can visit the Western Cape Education Department’s website (available from 14:00 onwards).
