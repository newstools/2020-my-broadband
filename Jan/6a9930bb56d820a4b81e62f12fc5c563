For the second year in a row, Sony will not be attending E3, GamesIndustry.biz reports. The company said it does not believe that E3’s vision is aligned with its own 2020 goals, and it will instead attend a variety of hundreds of consumer events. “After thorough evaluation, SIE has decided not to participate in E3 2020,” a Sony Interactive Entertainment spokesperson said. “We have great respect for the ESA as an organization, but we do not feel the vision of E3 2020 is the right venue for what we are focused on this year.” Sony said it is focused on ensuring that its fans feel like they are “part of the PlayStation family”. “We have a fantastic line up of titles coming to PlayStation 4, and with the upcoming launch of PlayStation 5, we are truly looking forward to a year of celebration with our fans.” Sony has previously announced that it will be launching the PlayStation 5 in “holiday 2020” – meaning that it will only be available towards the end of this year. Tech leaker @PSErebus has tweeted that the PlayStation 5 will have a US release date of 20 November 2020 and will be available for $499. Previous reports indicated that Sony could release its PlayStation 5 Pro console at the same time as the PlayStation 5. The Pro model is expected to cost up to $150 more than the standard PlayStation 5.
