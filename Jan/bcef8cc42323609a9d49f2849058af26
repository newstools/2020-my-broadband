Showmax has published a list of the most popular series on its platform for 2019, along with viewer data from over the holiday season. The company found that South Africans collectively viewed more than 100 years’ worth of video on Showmax over Christmas and New Year. “More people than ever before got on the streaming bandwagon, and those who were watching streamed more than usual,” Showmax said. “The net effect was a 30% increase in viewing hours compared to the average seen in prior months.” Viewing activity was highest on 29 December, and Showmax saw a big increase in binge-watching from subscribers over the holiday period. “For our most popular series, once people had locked on they watched on average more than 30 episodes of the same show over the holiday period,” Showmax said. “The peak binge by a single account was more than 200 episodes of the same show.” Crime drama, medical drama, and comedy were all popular genres among binge-watching South Africans, and Showmax said that local viewers watched far more movies than usual over the festive season. “South Africans clearly take their leisure time seriously, with average hours per viewer up 21% compared to normal activity.” Showmax said that going forward, viewers can look out for more blockbusters like A Star is Born and Aquaman, as well as more sports offerings. “2020 will see more top-flight sport, including more football from major local and international leagues coming live to Showmax,” Showmax said. The most popular international and local shows on Showmax in 2019 are detailed below, in no particular order. <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-231179" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Game-of-Thrones-header.jpg" alt="Game of Thrones header" width="640" height="430" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Game-of-Thrones-header.jpg 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Game-of-Thrones-header-300x202.jpg 300w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Game-of-Thrones-header-595x400.jpg 595w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> <img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-334500" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Trackers-640x349.png" alt="Trackers" width="640" height="349" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Trackers-640x349.png 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Trackers-600x327.png 600w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Trackers-768x419.png 768w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Trackers.png 1144w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" />
