MTN has launched dedicated TikTok data bundles, ranging from R5 for a daily bundle of 100MB to R50 for a monthly bundle of 1GB. This launch follows MTN SA CEO Godfrey Motsa promising customers last year that MTN would cater for the growing number of TikTok users in South Africa. TikTok is an app dedicated to short video content and has surpassed 1 billion and 1.5 billion global downloads on the App Store and Google Play Store respectively. MTN said that while no official figures are available to measure the app’s popularity in South Africa, videos categorised using the hashtag #tiktoksouthafrica have in excess of 400 million views. “We have heard our customers and hope that the launch of these bundles will enable them to make the most of what is arguably the fastest growing social platform amongst the youth,” said Jacqui ‘O Sullivan, Corporate Affairs Executive at MTN SA. “We are committed to providing products and solutions that resonate with our customers, and the introduction of our TikTok bundles is another such offering.” The three dedicated TikTok bundles offered by MTN can be viewed in the table below.
