AMD will launch its 600-series chipsets in the second half of 2020, according to a report from DigiTimes. Industry sources claimed that Taiwanese-based ASMedia has been appointed as one of the manufacturers for the new range of chipsets, in addition to two new budget entries to the 500-series. The 600-series will succeed the X570 range of motherboards and support AMD’s next generation of desktop processors, expected to be called the Ryzen 4000 series, which are based on AMD’s 7nm+ Zen 3 architecture. The two other AMD chipsets that ASMedia will manufacture are the A520 and B550. On Monday it was revealed these new budget chipsets are expected to enter manufacturing during the course of Q1 2020 and will be available in the first half of 2020. Few details have been revealed about the specifications of these chipsets. ASMedia further said it expects increased demand for the USB 3.2 Gen 2×2 controller chip, which supports transmission rates of up to 20Gbps. Intel’s current chipsets only support USB 3.2 Gen 2, which deliver a maximum data transfer speed of 10Gbps. ASMedia is reportedly also working on implementing a new USB 4 interface, the next standard that will offer a 40Gbps transmission rate, the same speed as Thunderbolt 3.
