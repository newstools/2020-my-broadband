Researchers from Monash University in Australia have designed a smartphone battery which they claim can last up to five continuous days between charges. Dr Mahdokht Shaibani from the university’s Department of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering guided an international team to create an ultra-high capacity lithium-sulphur (Li-S) battery that boasts better performance than current lithium-ion (Li-ion) packs. According to the team, the Li-S battery pack is the most-efficient of its kind, and its design could also be repurposed to build an electric vehicle battery capable of providing 1,000km of range. The researchers were able to reconfigure sulphur cathodes to enable higher stress loads without a loss in overall capacity or performance. “Inspired by unique bridging architecture first recorded in processing detergent powders in the 1970s, the team engineered a method that created bonds between particles to accommodate stress and deliver a level of stability not seen in any battery to date,” an article from Monash University stated. The researchers claimed their solution has less of an environmental impact than conventional lithium-ion batteries. Associate Professor Matthew Hill stated that the battery’s manufacturing process is both affordable and safe. “This approach not only favours high-performance metrics and long cycle life, but is also simple and extremely low-cost to manufacture, using water-based processes, and can lead to significant reductions in environmentally hazardous waste,” Hill said. The team has received a patent for the design and prototype battery cells have already been developed in Germany. It also said that several of the world’s leading battery makers have shown interest in upscaling manufacturing. The battery will now undergo additional testing in solar grids and cars in Australia.
