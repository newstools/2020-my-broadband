A further 78,984 achieved a higher certificate pass. “The NSC examination processes have been consistently reviewed and strengthened over the past 25 years and the qualification is therefore trusted by employers, higher education institutions, and the South African public,” Motshekga said. “The achievements of the class of 2019 confirm that the standard and quality of the South African examinations system is improving annually and stabilising.” The matric pass rates for South Africa’s provinces were also detailed by Motshekga.
