Takealot is the largest online retailer in South Africa and is known for its good order and delivery systems. It has a wide range of products, too, meaning you can order what you want and get it delivered to your door. But what happens if you need to return an item – is the process quick and easy? To find out, MyBroadband tested its returns process after a pair of our office headphones – which were still under warranty – stopped working properly. The results of the test are below. As the purchaser of the headphones, I logged into my Takealot account and went to the “Log Return” menu. You are presented with two buttons: one to log a new exchange or return, and one to track your returns. Takealot also states that returns follow four steps: <img class="aligncenter wp-image-333724 size-large" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Takealot-640x427.jpg" alt="Takealot" width="640" height="427" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Takealot-640x427.jpg 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Takealot-600x400.jpg 600w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Takealot-768x512.jpg 768w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Takealot.jpg 1050w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> After clicking on “Log New” exchange, you are taken to a list of all your previous Takealot orders. You are then required to navigate to the item you wish to return and click on the “Return” button next to it. This takes you to a “Return Request” page, which requires you to complete a short online form made up of three sections. After completing the form, you submit the request. <img class="aligncenter wp-image-333728 size-large" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Process-640x256.jpg" alt="Process" width="640" height="256" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Process-640x256.jpg 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Process-600x240.jpg 600w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Process.jpg 750w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> The online process above was quick and easy, and we selected the “courier collection” option. After submitting the request, we received an email and SMS from Takealot acknowledging the submission. The messages from Takealot contained more information on what would take place next, including: We logged our return on a Wednesday at 09:00, and the headphones were collected the next day from our office. A new pair of headphones were then delivered the following Monday at 11:22. Excluding the weekend, this means the return took two business days from online submission to the new pair of headphones being delivered to us. Overall, the Takealot online returns process was excellent. It was quick and easy, and the collection and delivery of the old and new headphones, respectively, meant there was no need to go back to a store with a slip and explain what happened. This is an opinion piece, based on testing.
