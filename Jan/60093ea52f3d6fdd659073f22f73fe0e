A message is being circulated on WhatsApp claiming that the messaging platform is giving away 1,000GB of “free Internet”. According to the message, this is to celebrate WhatsApp’s 10th anniversary. “You can now activate a free Internet bundle of 1,000GB without Wi-Fi with WhatsApp. Hurry to get it before the end of the offer!” The message is a hoax, however, and to make it convincing the developers behind it have made the link preview in WhatsApp for their website appear as “whatsapp.com”. <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-335746" style="border: 1px solid black;" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/WhatsApp-1000GB-free-data-hoax-message.jpg" alt="Screenshot of WhatsApp 1000GB free data hoax message" width="640" height="259" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/WhatsApp-1000GB-free-data-hoax-message.jpg 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/WhatsApp-1000GB-free-data-hoax-message-600x243.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> However, if you click the link you get taken to roomedic.com and not whatsapp.com. The website appears to host a survey and asks the following three questions: After answering the three questions, the website claims to analyse your answers and then demands that you share the offer with 20 friends or 5 groups to get your 1,000GB of “free Internet”. <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-335738" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/WhatsApp-1000GB-free-data-hoax-survey.jpg" alt="Screenshot of WhatsApp 1000GB free data hoax survey" width="640" height="388" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/WhatsApp-1000GB-free-data-hoax-survey.jpg 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/WhatsApp-1000GB-free-data-hoax-survey-600x364.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" />  <img class="aligncenter wp-image-335740 size-full" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/WhatsApp-1000GB-free-data-hoax-analysing-survey-results-popup.jpg" alt="Screenshot of WhatsApp 1000GB free data hoax analysing survey results popup" width="640" height="327" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/WhatsApp-1000GB-free-data-hoax-analysing-survey-results-popup.jpg 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/WhatsApp-1000GB-free-data-hoax-analysing-survey-results-popup-600x307.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-335744" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/WhatsApp-1000GB-free-data-hoax-sharing.jpg" alt="Screenshot of WhatsApp 1000GB free data hoax sharing demand" width="640" height="390" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/WhatsApp-1000GB-free-data-hoax-sharing.jpg 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/WhatsApp-1000GB-free-data-hoax-sharing-600x366.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> Sending the message to 20 contacts won’t achieve anything, though. A snippet of the JavaScript that is executed when you click on the “Invite” or “Continue” buttons is shown below: if ( c > 20 ) {
window.open( ‘#’ );
} This means the hoax site will simply open another copy of itself after you have shared it 20 times.
