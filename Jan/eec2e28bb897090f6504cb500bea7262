EOH has released a statement confirming that its chairman, Dr Xolani Mkhwanazi, has passed away. Mkhwanazi died on Saturday morning at the Wits Donald Gordon Medical Centre in Johannesburg, having been admitted to the facility on 14 December 2019. “EOH would like to express its deepest sympathies to the family of Dr Mkhwanazi, during this difficult time,” the company said. Mkhwanazi was appointed to the EOH board on 5 June 2019 as chairman and independent non-executive director. “I worked closely with Dr Mkhwanazi who played a pivotal role in helping to guide EOH towards a better future,” said EOH Group CEO Stephen van Coller. “Dr Mkhwanazi led the board deliberations on all group matters, but most notably during the tough deliberations around the findings of the ENSafrica investigation commissioned by EOH into public sector contracts.” “During this period Dr Mkhwanazi braved a difficult time always striving to do the right thing. He grasped the issues and dealt with them quickly. He will be sorely missed.” EOH said that Andrew Mthembu, its lead independent non-executive director, has been appointed as its interim chairperson while the board runs a process to appoint a new chairperson.
