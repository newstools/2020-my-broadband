Samsung has announced its new range of 8K QLED TVs at CES 2020. The flagship Q950TS is Samsung’s first TV to combine premium 8K picture quality, surround sound audio, and an ultra-thin form factor. It features a processor which Samsung claimed is capable of upscaling any lower resolution content to 8K. “Based on powerful Samsung semiconductor technology, the Q950’s next-generation Quantum Processor 8K features improved AI-based upscaling capabilities that use machine learning to analyze and identify the characteristics of individual pixels,” Samsung said. “It then restores different elements of the image to create a pristine 8K picture, regardless of the content source.” Head of Consumer Electronics Business at Samsung Electronics America, Joe Stinziano, said 2020 will be an important year for the 8K standard. “2020 will be a tipping point for our industry, the year when 8K broke into the mainstream as the definitive viewing experience,” Stinziano said. Samsung said all of its 8K sets meet recently-established criteria for 8K certification from the 8K Association and Consumer Technology Association (CTA). “Every Samsung 8K TV shipping today meets the requirements of the 8K Association’s Certified Test Specifications and carries the CTA 8K Ultra HD Display Definition logo.” 2020’s QLED 8K TVs will support built-in capability for 8K footage using the AV1 codec. The TVs also come with Samsung’s Adaptive Picture AI feature, which analyzes ambient light in the room as well as the scene that is played on the screen, to “optimize brightness and maintain contrast in high-glare environments”. Each side of the Q950’s display includes speakers, with subwoofers at the back of the TV. It employs a feature called Object Tracking Sound Plus (OTS+) to detect where objects are on a screen and to move sound dynamically between the speakers for a virtual 5.1 channel surround sound effect. In terms of the design of the Q950, Samsung said the bezels have been “practically eliminated” and the TV boasts a 99% screen-to-body-ratio, which it claimed is the highest in the industry. “When consumers watch from the average viewing distance of ten to fifteen feet, the bezels disappear to create an immersive Infinity Screen effect,” Samsung said. It is 15mm thick with a completely flat back that lets you place it flush against the wall. Samsung has not yet revealed a launch date or pricing for its line-up of new 8K QLED TVs. <img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-334096" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/2020-Samsung-QLED-8K-Q950_01-640x324.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="324" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/2020-Samsung-QLED-8K-Q950_01-640x324.jpg 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/2020-Samsung-QLED-8K-Q950_01-600x304.jpg 600w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/2020-Samsung-QLED-8K-Q950_01-768x389.jpg 768w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/2020-Samsung-QLED-8K-Q950_01.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" />
