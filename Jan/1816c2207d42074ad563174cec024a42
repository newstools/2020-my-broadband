Samsung recently revealed two new smartphones in its Galaxy A-series range – the Galaxy A51 and Galaxy A71. While these smartphones are more affordable than the Galaxy S and Note line-ups, they still offer a number of flagship smartphone features and share similar physical designs. Compared to their predecessors – the Galaxy A50 and A70 – the new device boast a number of improvements. The Galaxy A71 and A51 pack a longer-lasting battery, a smarter camera, and an Infinity-O display. “We know that people want a device that looks good, lasts longer, and captures every experience as it happens – and we’re proud to continue to deliver on those needs with the latest Galaxy A devices,” the company said. Samsung’s Galaxy A51 and Galaxy A71 share similar features, especially when it comes to their displays and camera configurations. The Galaxy A51 and A71 both have quad-lens rear camera systems with Depth, Main, Ultra-wide, and Macro sensors. The Depth (5MP), Ultra-wide (12MP), and Macro (5MP) sensors are identical on both devices, while the Galaxy A51 has a 48MP main sensor and the Galaxy A71 boasts 64MP. The phones also feature on-screen fingerprint scanners, facial recognition, large batteries, microSD support up to 512GB, and AMOLED displays with identical resolutions – 1,800 x 2,400. These devices do have different internal components, however – the Galaxy A71 has a Dual 2.2GHz + Hexa 1.8GHz chipset configuration, while the Galaxy A51 uses a Quad 2.3GHz + Quad 1.7GHz setup. Samsung states that the Galaxy A51 will be available with 4GB, 6GB, or 8GB of RAM and 64GB or 128GB of internal storage. The Galaxy A71 can be configured with 6GB or 8GB of RAM and has 128GB of internal storage. The biggest difference between the two devices, however, is their size and battery capacity. The 6.7-inch Galaxy A71 has a larger battery than the 6.5-inch Galaxy A51 – 4,500mAh vs 4,000mAh – while also being 0.2mm thinner. The infographics below, from Samsung, provide a brief overview of the difference between the two devices. Pricing and launch dates for the smartphones were not disclosed by Samsung at the time of writing. <img class="aligncenter wp-image-334192" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Galaxy-A51-infographic.jpg" alt="Galaxy A51 infographic" width="640" height="915" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Galaxy-A51-infographic.jpg 1600w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Galaxy-A51-infographic-280x400.jpg 280w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Galaxy-A51-infographic-301x430.jpg 301w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Galaxy-A51-infographic-768x1098.jpg 768w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Galaxy-A51-infographic-1074x1536.jpg 1074w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Galaxy-A51-infographic-1432x2048.jpg 1432w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Galaxy-A51-infographic-1200x1716.jpg 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> <img class="aligncenter wp-image-334194" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Galaxy-A71-infographic.jpg" alt="Galaxy A71 infographic" width="640" height="915" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Galaxy-A71-infographic.jpg 1600w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Galaxy-A71-infographic-280x400.jpg 280w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Galaxy-A71-infographic-301x430.jpg 301w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Galaxy-A71-infographic-768x1098.jpg 768w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Galaxy-A71-infographic-1074x1536.jpg 1074w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Galaxy-A71-infographic-1432x2048.jpg 1432w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Galaxy-A71-infographic-1200x1716.jpg 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> The table below details the devices’ specifications. <img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-333940" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/A51-Image-640x360.jpg" alt="A51" width="640" height="360" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/A51-Image-640x360.jpg 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/A51-Image-600x338.jpg 600w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/A51-Image-768x432.jpg 768w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/A51-Image.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> <img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-333942" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/A71-Image-640x360.jpg" alt="A71" width="640" height="360" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/A71-Image-640x360.jpg 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/A71-Image-600x338.jpg 600w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/A71-Image-768x432.jpg 768w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/A71-Image.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" />
