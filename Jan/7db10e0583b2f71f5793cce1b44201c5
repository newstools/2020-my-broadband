Google will add more than 100 new titles and several features to its Stadia game streaming service in 2020. The service was officially launched in November 2019 across 14 regions, including the US, Canada, UK, and several European countries. In a community post, the company said that players will have 120 more games to choose from by the end of the year. 10 of the games launching in the first half of the year will be exclusive to Stadia, Google said. Google did not specify the names of any upcoming titles, but it previously confirmed that 2020 releases would include Cyberpunk 2077, Doom: Eternal, Watch Dogs: Legion, and Gods & Monsters. In terms of features, Google said it will add 4K resolution support for game streaming on the web version of the platform. The web version will also get more Google Assistant functionality as well as support for wireless gameplay with the Stadia controller. Stadia’s mobile streaming service is currently only officially supported on Google’s Pixel phones. However, Google announced that more Android phones will offer support for Stadia in the coming months. The company promised “a lot more” for the year ahead, and said it would name the games coming to Stadia Pro subscription holders towards the end of the month.
