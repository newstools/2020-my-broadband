In the middle of 2012, Afrihost launched its latest broadband product – a 10Mbps uncapped ADSL account. At the time, it made a big splash as it was much cheaper than competing products on the market – only R997 per month. This excluded the fees you would need to pay for Telkom copper line rental and ADSL access, which were R139 and R413 per month, respectively. This brought your total monthly broadband bill to R1,549 per month. While this sounds expensive by today’s standards, it was a great deal at the time. 10Mbps uncapped ADSL accounts from MWEB, Axxess, and Webafrica were priced between R1,800 and R2,500 per month. Today, 10Mbps uncapped ADSL is not the first choice for Internet users. Fibre and fixed-LTE connectivity packages are preferred thanks to their higher upload speeds, lower latency, lower prices, improved stability, and the fact that Telkom copper line rental is not required. Users can sign up for an uncapped 10Mbps fibre package for well under half the price of a 2012 ADSL connection, while fixed-LTE packages start from R250 per month (with capped usage). To illustrate how broadband products have changed over the years, the graphics below detail the prices of uncapped 10Mbps ADSL packages, including access fees and line rentals, and compare them against uncapped 10Mbps fibre packages today. For the purposes of the article, Openserve fibre pricing was used. <img class="aligncenter wp-image-334544 size-large" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Afrihost-640x359.jpg" alt="Afrihost" width="640" height="359" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Afrihost-640x359.jpg 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Afrihost-600x336.jpg 600w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Afrihost-768x430.jpg 768w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Afrihost.jpg 1162w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> <img class="aligncenter wp-image-334580 size-large" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Webafrica-640x359.jpg" alt="Webafrica" width="640" height="359" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Webafrica-640x359.jpg 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Webafrica-600x336.jpg 600w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Webafrica-768x430.jpg 768w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Webafrica.jpg 1162w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> <img class="aligncenter wp-image-334582 size-large" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Axxess-640x359.jpg" alt="Axxess" width="640" height="359" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Axxess-640x359.jpg 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Axxess-600x336.jpg 600w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Axxess-768x430.jpg 768w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Axxess.jpg 1162w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> <img class="aligncenter wp-image-334584 size-large" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/MWEB-640x359.jpg" alt="MWEB" width="640" height="359" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/MWEB-640x359.jpg 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/MWEB-600x336.jpg 600w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/MWEB-768x430.jpg 768w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/MWEB.jpg 1162w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" />
