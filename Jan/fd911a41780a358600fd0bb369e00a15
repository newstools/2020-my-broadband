Samsung has launched the 5G version of its Galaxy Tab S6 tablet, which is the first tablet in the world to offer 5G connectivity. The Galaxy Tab S6 5G is exactly the same as the original Tab S6 except for its ability to support the next generation of mobile communications technology. It is powered by a Qualcomm Snapdragon 855 processor and offers 6GB of RAM with 128GB of storage. Unlike the original Tab S6 5G, however, it uses a Snapdragon X50 5G modem – which replaces the X24 LTE modem in the original Tab S6. The Galaxy Tab S6 5G will launch exclusively in South Korea on 30 January and will retail for the equivalent of R12,500. Consumers who purchase the device will receive various other benefits – including a free Samsung Book Cover keyboard. It is unclear whether the Tab S6 5G will be launched in other markets. The specifications for the Galaxy Tab S6 5G are below.
