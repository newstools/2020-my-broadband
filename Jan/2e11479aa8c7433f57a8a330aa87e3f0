Intel showcased its first discrete graphics card in more than 20 years at CES 2020. The company showed its dedicated DG1 GPU running Warframe and Destiny 2 on a laptop during its event. Linus Tech Tips identified the laptop as a Compal prototype and determined that it was running the latter title in 1080p, locked at 60fps. Intel has now shared images of the DG1 chip implemented as a standalone developer sample card – a full-sized graphics cards with a PCIe connector, a single fan, and RGB lighting. The Intel DG1 won’t be offered in this form factor for consumer desktops, however, but is expected to be implemented in laptops or as part of an APU for desktop systems. Intel has not provided any clock speeds, GPU core count, VRAM, or other technical specifications for the DG1. The company did state that it will use an architecture known as Xe for its new generation of graphics development. Xe is divided into three microarchitectures for scaling on systems with different levels of workloads. The Xe LP microarchitecture will mainly be employed in laptops, Xe HP will be used in desktops, and Xe HPC will be used in high-performance systems such as servers. Images of the DG1 developer sample graphics card are shown below. <img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-334760" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Intel-DG1_headline-2-640x430.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="430" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Intel-DG1_headline-2.jpeg 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Intel-DG1_headline-2-595x400.jpeg 595w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Intel-DG1_headline-2-300x202.jpeg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> <img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-334782" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Intel-DG1-graphics-card_1-640x360.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="360" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Intel-DG1-graphics-card_1-640x360.jpg 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Intel-DG1-graphics-card_1-600x338.jpg 600w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Intel-DG1-graphics-card_1-768x432.jpg 768w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Intel-DG1-graphics-card_1.jpg 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> <img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-334784" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Intel-DG1-graphics-card_2-640x360.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="360" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Intel-DG1-graphics-card_2-640x360.jpg 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Intel-DG1-graphics-card_2-600x338.jpg 600w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Intel-DG1-graphics-card_2-768x432.jpg 768w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Intel-DG1-graphics-card_2.jpg 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> <img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-334786" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Intel-DG1-graphics-card_3-640x427.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="427" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Intel-DG1-graphics-card_3-640x427.jpg 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Intel-DG1-graphics-card_3-600x400.jpg 600w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Intel-DG1-graphics-card_3-768x512.jpg 768w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Intel-DG1-graphics-card_3-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Intel-DG1-graphics-card_3-1200x800.jpg 1200w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Intel-DG1-graphics-card_3.jpg 2000w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" />
