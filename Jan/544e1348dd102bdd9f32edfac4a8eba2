Samsung has revealed two new high-end smartphones, the Galaxy S10 Lite and Galaxy Note 10 Lite. “Building on the legacy of the Galaxy S and Galaxy Note series, these Galaxy Lite models bring key premium features such as the latest camera technology, signature S Pen, immersive display, and a long-lasting battery at an accessible price point,” said Samsung. No launch window or pricing for the new devices were announced, however. The new smartphones are detailed below. The Galaxy S10 Lite is punted by Samsung as having the “ultimate pro-grade camera”, which is a triple sensor – 5MP + 48MP + 12MP – unit. “Bring your photography to the next level with the Galaxy S10 Lite, which features a main wide-angle camera and ultra-wide and macro cameras alongside the new Super Steady OIS,” said Samsung. “When paired with Super Steady mode, Super Steady OIS provides higher stability for action-focused photos and videos.” The device also packs a 6.7-inch AMOLED display, up to 8GB of RAM, and is powered by a 7nm 64-bit octa-core chipset. As expected, both the S10 Lite and Note 10 Lite will run Android 10. The smartphone’s specifications are listed below. <img class="aligncenter wp-image-333926 size-large" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Samsung-S10-Lite-640x426.jpg" alt="Samsung S10 Lite" width="640" height="426" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Samsung-S10-Lite-640x426.jpg 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Samsung-S10-Lite-600x400.jpg 600w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Samsung-S10-Lite-768x511.jpg 768w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Samsung-S10-Lite.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> The Galaxy Note 10 Lite is positioned as an “enhanced productivity” device by Samsung, thanks to its powerful hardware and S Pen stylus. “Bluetooth Low-Energy support means you can navigate a presentation, control your video content or take a picture, all with a simple click of the S Pen,” it said. “Air Command will also give you quick and easy access to the signature S Pen features you need quickly and easily.” On the hardware side, the Note 10 Lite has a 6.7-inch AMOLED screen, up to 8GB of RAM, a 4,500mAh battery, and a 10nm 64-bit octa-core chipset.
