Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies surged in price over the last few years, leading to keen interest from institutional and everyday investors. The price of Bitcoin is volatile, however, and for every story of investors who doubled or tripled their money, there are many with almost nothing. If you purchased even a small amount of Bitcoin before the big price jump in 2017 and held on to it, your investment would have paid off handsomely. This is especially true for those who were interested in the technology when it was launched – even if they had bought only a few rands worth of Bitcoin at the time. To see the growth, we looked at what would happen to your cryptocurrency wealth if you purchased just R1 worth of Bitcoin in 2010, and how much it would be worth in rand today. Rand values reflect the US dollar-rand exchange rates for each year.
