Eskom is in crisis, and paying R1.8 billion in performance bonuses does not fall within a framework of crisis thinking. This is the view of Solidarity chief executive Dirk Hermann, who responded to a City Press report that Eskom wants taxpayers to cough up a further R1.8 billion for performance bonuses. According to the report, Eskom wants to pay R1.8 billion in performance bonuses between 2019 and 2022. The National Energy Regulator of South Africa (Nersa) said Eskom did not reveal this plan in its tariff applications. Nersa was not supportive of the public having to pay for the incompetence and maladministration at Eskom, City Press said. Hermann said Eskom is hopelessly bankrupt and operationally fragile due to years of looting, mismanagement, and race obsession. “Eskom is in crisis and should be treated as a crisis,” Hermann said. “If Eskom is not treated as if it is in business rescue, it is going to explode on itself and South Africa,” he added. Hermann said Eskom’s bonus policy states that bonuses will only be paid out if the company makes a profit. “It is common practice in all companies for bonuses to fund themselves. It should be that way in Eskom as well.” Hermann said Solidarity is in favour of rewarding those who perform exceptionally well under the dire circumstances at Eskom. “There are unsung heroes in Eskom who keep our lights on. Solidarity members and many other employees’ work ethics force them to work hours in overtime to keep the place going,” he said. However, Hermann added that there are also looters who still walk around freely. “The performers have to be compensated, the looters have to be prosecuted and the lazy have to be fired,” he said. Eskom was asked for comment regarding the reported bonuses, but the company did not respond by the time of publication.
