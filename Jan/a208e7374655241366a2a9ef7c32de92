AMD unveiled four new graphics cards at CES 2020. The line-up includes two new cards for desktops – the Radeon RX 5600 XT and RX 5600 – and two for laptops – the Radeon RX 5600M and RX 5700M. According to the company, these cards are intended for high-performance gaming at 1080p. AMD has claimed that the RX 5600 GPUs offer up to twice the performance-per-watt compared to its previous Radeon RX 590 graphics card thanks to the new generation’s improved architecture. “Built on AMD RDNA architecture and industry-leading 7nm process technology, alongside high-bandwidth PCIe 4.0 technology and high-speed GDDR6 memory, AMD Radeon RX 5600 series graphics deliver ultra-high levels of performance and power efficiency,” AMD said. According to AMD, the top-end Radeon RX 5600 XT boasts a 20% performance increase over its direct competitor, Nvidia’s GeForce GTX 1660 Ti. The company detailed several of the new features supported by the RX 5600 range. These include Radeon Boost, which increases frame rates and fluidity by dynamically reducing the resolution of images without a “perceptible change” in image quality. AMD said this could lead to a 37% performance boost in Overwatch when played at 1440p. Another feature is Radeon Anti-Lag, which AMD claims reduces input-to-display response times, delivering up to 22% more responsiveness in Apex Legends. AMD’s Radeon RX 5600 XT graphics card will be available from 21 January 2020 for $279 (R4,000). The Radeon RX 5600 will first launch in the Alienware Aurora gaming PC, while the RX 5600M will ship in the Dell G5 15 SE gaming laptop. These two cards and the Radeon RX 5700M will launch in OEM systems in the first quarter of 2020. The table below shows the specifications of AMD’s four new graphics cards.
