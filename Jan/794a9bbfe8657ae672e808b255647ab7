Acer has launched its ConceptD 7 Ezel series convertible RTX Studio laptops at CES 2020. Acer said these laptops are designed for users who need a powerful device, such as filmmakers, animators, and AEC (architecture, engineering, and construction) designers. “Ideally suited for professionals creating 2D and 3D work, we’re excited to expand the line with these powerful new tools that can assist more creators,” said Acer co-COO Jerry Kao. The ConceptD 7 Ezel laptop will include up to a 10th-generation Intel Core H-series processor, Nvidia RTX GPU, 32GB of memory, and 2TB of NVMe PCIe SSD storage. “Creators can quickly edit and render videos or create 3D animations and showcase their work in real-time,” the company said. The ConceptD 7 Ezel Pro offers even better performance, boasting an Intel Xeon processor, Nvidia Quadro RTX graphics, Windows 10 Pro, and ECC memory support. Both devices have 4K IPS displays with a 400-nit high-brightness rating and 100% Adobe RGB colour gamut coverage. Acer’s Ezel hinge enables the devices to be used in five modes – sharing mode, floating mode, stand mode, pad mode, and display mode. “A desktop replacement that can be taken on the road, the ConceptD 7 Ezel series is ideal for creators who want to sketch, finalize and present on one device,” Acer said. Acer also unveiled its ConceptD 700 desktop workstation, which features an Intel Xeon E processor and up to Nvidia Quadro RTX 4000 graphics. The ConceptD 700 also includes up to 64GB memory and PCIe M.2 SSD storage. “It’s a beautiful addition to any modern studio with quiet operation of just 40 dBA and minimalist Scandinavian design-inspired aesthetics that include a white finish, woodgrain-inspired top side and smooth rounded corners,” said Acer. The ConceptD 700 uses three cooling fans to ensure the workstation is operating optimally, and offers wireless charging for smartphones on the top of the computer case. The recommended pricing for these new ConceptD devices are as follows: <img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-334112" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/ConceptD-7-series-640x430.png" alt="" width="640" height="430" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/ConceptD-7-series.png 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/ConceptD-7-series-595x400.png 595w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/ConceptD-7-series-300x202.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> <img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-334110" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/ConceptD-7-series-2-640x430.png" alt="" width="640" height="430" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/ConceptD-7-series-2-640x430.png 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/ConceptD-7-series-2-595x400.png 595w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/ConceptD-7-series-2-300x202.png 300w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/ConceptD-7-series-2-768x516.png 768w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/ConceptD-7-series-2.png 1152w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> <img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-334108" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/ConceptD-7-series-3-640x430.png" alt="" width="640" height="430" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/ConceptD-7-series-3-640x430.png 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/ConceptD-7-series-3-595x400.png 595w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/ConceptD-7-series-3-300x202.png 300w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/ConceptD-7-series-3-768x516.png 768w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/ConceptD-7-series-3.png 1097w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> <img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-334106" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/ConceptD-700-640x430.png" alt="" width="640" height="430" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/ConceptD-700-640x430.png 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/ConceptD-700-595x400.png 595w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/ConceptD-700-300x202.png 300w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/ConceptD-700-768x516.png 768w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/ConceptD-700-1200x807.png 1200w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/ConceptD-700.png 1318w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> <img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-334114" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/ConceptD-700-2-640x430.png" alt="" width="640" height="430" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/ConceptD-700-2-640x430.png 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/ConceptD-700-2-595x400.png 595w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/ConceptD-700-2-300x202.png 300w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/ConceptD-700-2-768x516.png 768w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/ConceptD-700-2-1200x807.png 1200w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/ConceptD-700-2.png 1266w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" />
