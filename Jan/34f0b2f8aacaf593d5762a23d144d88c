MTN announced that the Attorney General of Nigeria (AGF) has withdrawn its $2-billion tax demand against the company, and referred the matter to the tax authorities. “MTN Nigeria has been informed… the AGF has decided to refer the matter to the relevant authorities, being the Federal Inland Revenue Service and Nigeria Customs, with a view to them resolving the issues,” said MTN. “Accordingly, the AGF has withdrawn its letter of demand for the aforementioned $2 billion that was issued in August 2018.” MTN said it will follow court process to withdraw its legal action against the AGF and engage with the relevant bodies on this issue. MTN Nigeria previously filed a lawsuit after the AGF issued a demand for unpaid duties and taxes, with the company challenging the authority of the AGF to deal with issues around tax and custom duties. According to the law, oversight for this is the responsibility of the Federal Inland Revenue Service and Nigerian Customs, MTN said. “MTN remains committed to building and maintaining cordial relationships with all regulatory authorities in Nigeria,” it said.
