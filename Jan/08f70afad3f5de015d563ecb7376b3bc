Google South Africa has appointed Alistair Mokoena as its new country director. Mokoena previously served as Ogilvy South Africa CEO and has a long history in the South African advertising sector. He holds an LLB from Rhodes University, an MBA from MANCOSA, and is working towards a PhD from the North West University School of Business. He is also the chairperson on the board of the Interactive Advertising Bureau (IAB) South Africa. “Google is working hard to bring more Africans online, to unlock economic opportunities through working with local communities, and to make our products more helpful to Africans in the African continent,” said Google Africa director Nitin Gajria. “Mokoena’s knowledge and expertise will be key to helping us deliver on these goals in the local market.” Mokoena will begin as country director in April and will oversee Google South Africa’s commercial business. “The digital economy presents many challenges and opportunities – particularly in developing markets like South Africa’s,” said Mokoena. “Technology is mainstream and the online, digital world is no longer a challenger to the offline world. I am looking forward to joining Google South Africa, which is well-positioned to help South African organisations navigate a rapidly changing landscape as the online and offline worlds converge.”
