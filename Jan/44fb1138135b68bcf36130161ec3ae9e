Intel will launch Thunderbolt 4 as part of its Tiger Lake Core mobile processors in 2020, the company announced at CES 2020. Thunderbolt 4 will offer four-times the throughput of USB 3.1, the company said. While this may sound impressive, it means that Thunderbolt 4 does not offer speeds any faster than Thunderbolt 3. USB 3.1 offers speeds of up to 10Gbps, while Thunderbolt 3 already offers 40Gbps of throughput. Intel has said that other changes will come to Thunderbolt 4 which will make it a valuable upgrade, however. “It standardizes PC platform requirements and adds the latest Thunderbolt innovations,” Intel spokesperson Sarah Kane said. Kane said Intel will share more details about Thunderbolt 4 at a later date. Thunderbolt first entered the mainstream market in 2011 when Apple decided to use the technology in its devices. A number of Windows PCs have since followed suit – including several high-end gaming laptops. Thunderbolt technology is often used in high-performance systems that require a powerful, multi-functional port. The port currently offers the following features: USB 4 is also expected to launch later this year and will incorporate Thunderbolt 3 technology – meaning it will offer speeds comparable to both Thunderbolt 3 and 4. CNET predicted that this would continue to limit Thunderbolt technology to high-end machines, with mainstream machines preferring USB 4.
