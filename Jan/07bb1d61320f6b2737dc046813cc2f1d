Netgear has unveiled a new 5G mobile hotspot called the Nighthawk M5. The M5 supports 5G cellular connectivity and distributes this to devices via its Wi-Fi 6 and Ethernet connections. “The Nighthawk M5 mobile router is designed to deliver a mobile lifestyle at its fullest potential or to be used as an alternative or backup option for home Internet with the gigabit Ethernet port,” said Netgear. The M5 can serve an entire home’s Internet needs by connecting via Ethernet to an existing home Wi-Fi network, or act as a failover connection thanks to its “long-lasting” lithium-ion battery. Netgear added the M5 has several standout features, which are listed below. Its 5G support allows for download speeds of up to 4Gbps, said Netgear. This is thanks to 5G NR sub-6GHz technology. The router also supports LTE CAT 22, LTE Advanced, 4×4 MIMO, and 256QAM. The M5’s Wi-Fi 6 connectivity (802.11ax) allows for up to 32 devices to be connected across its 2.4GHz and 5GHz bands. 2×2 MIMO and IPV6 support are additional features of the M5, added the company, This allows for a maximum throughput of 1.2Gbps over the 5GHz band, while the M5’s Ethernet port provides for speeds “close to 1Gbps” and its USB 3.1 Gen-2 port provides “close to 2.5Gbps”. The M5 is powered by a rechargeable lithium-ion battery, which Netgear said was long-lasting – but did not disclose its capacity. To avoid depleting and recharging the battery unnecessarily, users are also able to plug the M5 into a power socket and remove the battery completely when using it. Other features include a 2.4-inch colour LCD touch display which shows mobile signal strength, data usage, the SSID name, and the connected devices you can manage. This user control is augmented with the Netgear mobile app, which allows users to manage connections and devices from their smartphone or tablet. In terms of physical dimensions, the M5 is 105 x 105 x 21 mm and weighs 240g, said Netgear. The M5 mobile router is set to be available in May 2020 in the United States, with pricing to be announced at a later date. <img class="aligncenter wp-image-334268" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/M5-Image.jpg" alt="M5" width="640" height="549" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/M5-Image.jpg 700w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/M5-Image-467x400.jpg 467w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/M5-Image-502x430.jpg 502w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" />
