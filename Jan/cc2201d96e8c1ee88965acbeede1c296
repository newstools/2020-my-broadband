Specialist recruitment firm Michael Page has published its latest salary guide which sheds light on the average IT salaries in South Africa in 2020. According to Michael Page it has seen a decline in demand across most industries within South Africa, with certain industries feeling the impact more than others. “Companies are looking for ways to increase output and productivity, while at the same time cutting costs,” the group said. “Therefore, automation, robotics, artificial intelligence, digital and in broader terms, technology is playing a bigger role in achieving the above mentioned goals.” South Africa is also facing a brain drain of highly skilled labour who are opting to emigrate, the group noted, saying that this is creating a talent gap in the market. According to Michael Page’s survey data, 46% of job seekers in South Africa are not optimistic about the local job market and economy. There is, however, some optimism in the market with 62% of people believing that the environment will improve in the next six months. One of the top reasons people are looking for a new job is because their current role isn’t offering opportunities for further development. “Job seekers wanting their responsibilities to broaden, as well as seeking a better salary package, are other reasons motivating their job search,” the group said. Michael Page’s data for its salary benchmark is derived from the its proprietary database, capturing job advertisements and placements throughout 2019. It is also supplemented with data and insights from other studies such as quarterly job market surveys, and insights from interactions with clients and candidates. The tables below outline the salary ranges and averages for South African IT professionals across all sectors. The averages represent total annual salaries.
