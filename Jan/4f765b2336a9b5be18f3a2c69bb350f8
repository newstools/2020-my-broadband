On 7 January, the Department of Basic Education and Minister Angie Motshekga celebrated an all-time high matric pass rate of 81.3%. The official pass rate, however, only tells part of the story. The Democratic Alliance (DA) highlighted that the 81.3% pass rate does not take the high dropout rate into account. In 2017, a total of 1,052,080 learners were enrolled in grade 10, yet only 409,906 learners eventually passed matric last year. “This means only 38.9% of grade 10 learners actually wrote and passed matric,” the DA said, adding that the real pass rate is therefore 38.9%. “This is for the most part due to an extraordinarily high dropout rate, which means that hundreds of thousands of learners are denied the chance to write matric, let alone pass it,” the DA said. Since 2015, which saw the highest number of pupils who sat to write their matric exam, there has been a steady decline each year. This should be a real and urgent concern for the Department of Basic Education. The Western Cape is the province with the lowest dropout rate (33.4%) and therefore the highest real pass rate, standing at 54.8%, stated the DA. The Free State, which is the top-performing province with a pass rate of 88.4%, has such a high dropout rate that its real pass rate only stands at 38.4%. The table below shows the real matric pass rate in South Africa per province, based on the DA’s dropout analysis.
