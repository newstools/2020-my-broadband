Minister of Communications and Digital Technologies Stella Ndabeni-Abrahams has appointed Basil Ford as the executive caretaker of the Universal Service and Access Agency of South Africa (USAASA). Ford’s appointment follows the withdrawal of Newyear Ntuli from the position on 25 December 2019. As executive caretaker, Mr Ford will assume the roles of accounting authority and accounting officer. “The Executive Caretaker’s appointment comes as the Minister is seized with the responsibility of reconfiguring the department and its entities; as well as ensuring the successful implementation of the Broadcasting Digital Migration (BDM) programme,” said the Department of Communications and Digital Technologies. Ndabeni-Abrahams said Ford is a “consummate professional in the broadcasting, media, and ICT space who brings with him a wealth of experience gained from both government and state-owned entities.” Ford is a qualified engineer with a bachelor’s degree from Wits University. He also holds a BEng Honours from the University of Pretoria and an Executive Development Programme obtained from the Gordon Institute of Business Science. He worked for nearly two decades at the IDC, where he was responsible for investing in various companies in the media and broadcasting value chain, managing R2.3-billion worth of investments. Ford will serve in his new role for a 12-month period effective from 28 January 2020.
