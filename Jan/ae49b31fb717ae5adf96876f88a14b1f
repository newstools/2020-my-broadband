Despite Microsoft’s support for Windows 7 ending on 14 January, the company has released a new patch for the operating system that is available to all users. An issue in the final Windows 7 update issued during the official support period caused issues for some desktop wallpapers, replacing them with a plain background. Microsoft had originally resolved to only patch this minor issue for those who had purchased Windows 7’s Extended Security Updates, but it has since chosen to release the patch for all users. “We are working on a resolution and will provide an update in an upcoming release, which will be released to all customers running Windows 7 and Windows Server 2008 R2 SP1,” said Microsoft. Microsoft said that there are two workarounds to the issue in the interim: While Microsoft has decided to patch this flaw, it is unlikely that it will provide other new updates in the future for those who have not signed up to its Extended Security Updates product. For those who still have Windows 7, there is a workaround to upgrade to Windows 10 for free. Users can go to the Windows 10 download page and click on “Download tool now”. This will download the Media Creation Tool executable file. You should then be able to open this file and follow the instructions to install Windows 10 at no cost.
