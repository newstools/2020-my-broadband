South African ICT service provider ATIO is under business rescue and is in the process of applying to be liquidated. ATIO was founded in 1986 and is a privately-held provider of information and communications technology services in South Africa. In its early days, the company focussed on providing telecommunications infrastructure to the defence industry. Through the years the company diversified and became a leader in providing specialised ICT services to niche markets within all sectors of business. ATIO became a particularly strong player in the South African call centre and voice market by partnering with companies who are specialists in this field. At its peak, ATIO had multiple offices in South Africa and customers in numerous countries across the globe. In 2012, ATIO sold some of its contact centre assets to the UK-listed provider of unified IP business communications solutions Interactive Intelligence for R54 million. MyBroadband has learned that ATIO was put under business rescue in November 2019 and has applied to be liquidated. The ATIO website is no longer active, and visitors to the Atio.co.za and Atio.com domains are greeted with the message, “This Account has been suspended”. MyBroadband tried to contact ATIO for further information but could not reach anyone at the company.
