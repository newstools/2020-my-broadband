Dell recently launched a new high-end gaming monitor – the Alienware 25 – targeted at esports enthusiasts and professionals. The company said this display offers great image quality and gaming performance. “The new Alienware 25 gaming monitor provides the speed gamers need, coupled with the incredible colour details of IPS panels,” said Dell. Not to be outdone, Samsung also launched new gaming monitors – the Odyssey G7 and G9 – which it said were aimed squarely at gamers looking for a high-performance setup. “The new line-up has been completely reimagined with gamers in mind, including radically new curved displays and industry-leading performance features for a whole new way to game,” Samsung said. The Odyssey G9 is a 49-inch monster of a monitor which will appeal to those for whom money is no object. However, the G7 is significantly more affordable and more accessible to everyday gamers. We compared the specifications and features of these new Samsung and Alienware gaming monitors. Both the Samsung Odyssey G7 and G9 offer a 1ms response time and a 240Hz refresh rate. The G9 comprises a massive 49-inch QLED display with a resolution of 5,120 x 1,440 – leading Samsung to dub the monitor the “world’s first Dual Quad High-Definition” display. It boasts a peak brightness of 1,000 nits – significantly higher than the G7 and the Alienware 25. The G7 comes in two versions – 27-inch and 32-inch – both of which are QLED monitors. It delivers a 2,560 x 1,440 resolution and a peak brightness of 600 nits. Just like the Odyssey monitors, the Alienware 25 gaming monitor offers a 240Hz refresh rate and a 1ms response time. However, its IPS display offers a lower 1,920 x 1,080 resolution, it has a smaller 25-inch display, and it only offers a peak brightness of 400 nits. All three monitors support FreeSync and G-Sync. One area where the Alienware monitor shines is its design. It has an adjustable stand which uses thin legs that can fit underneath a keyboard – enabling close-up gaming. It can tilt, pivot, swivel and have its height adjusted in accordance with the user’s preferences. This stand also has a special ventilation system for improved cooling and AlienFX customisable lighting zones that respond to in-game events and user profiles. Both Samsung Odyssey monitors allow for the flexible adjustment of their height and viewing angle . The Odyssey G9 sports a glossy white finish with a glowing rear core that can display 52 colours and five different lighting effects. The G7 also comes with a rear core light which can either remain static or be dimmed during gameplay. The G7 sports a matte black colour scheme. “Both monitors feature an extremely deep curvature – the first ever monitors to possess a high-performance 1000R curvature with stunning QLED picture quality,” said Samsung. In contrast, the Alienware 25 monitor has a more traditional flat display. The Alienware 25 has a recommended retail price of $499 and will be available globally from 11 March 2020. The Odyssey G7 and G9 will both become available in the second quarter of 2020. No pricing has been made available by Samsung for these monitors. <img class="aligncenter wp-image-333966 size-large"
