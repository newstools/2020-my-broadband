Dell has unveiled the Latitude 9510, the first entry to its new 9000-series of business laptops. The company labelled the premium laptop the “world’s most intelligent 15-inch PC with built-in AI” and also the “smallest, lightest ultra-premium business 15-inch PC”. The most notable feature is the laptop’s claimed battery life. Dell said the Latitude 9510 is the “longest-running 15-inch PC”, lasting up to 30 hours between charges. Key to this is the the laptop’s pre-installed Dell Optimizer program. The software assesses user behaviour over time and identifies which programs should receive the largest amount of resources – in addition to optimising the laptop’s settings automatically when it detects the battery is running low. It also uses Dell’s express sign-in feature, which automatically detects whether the user is near the device to further save power. The Latitude 9510 will be available in a conventional clamshell (1.45kg) or 2-in-1 convertible (1.5kg) configuration. It features an aluminium chassis with thin bezels along its 15-inch display, and boasts up to a six-core 10th-generation Intel processor. On-the-go connectivity is made easy with 5G and Wi-Fi 6 support, added Dell. The Latitude 9510 will start at $1,799 and will be available globally from 26 March 2020.
