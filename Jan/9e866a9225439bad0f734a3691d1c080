Apple is expected to launch a smaller, more affordable smartphone in 2020. Japanese blog Macotakara has reported that Apple will name the device the iPhone 9. Apple fans have been asking for a smaller and more affordable iPhone for years, and the iPhone 9 appears to meet these requirements. There are many rumours about this device which have been circulating the Internet, and we have listed the most consistent ones below. The iPhone 9 is expected to be built using the same form factor as the iPhone 8 – which many believe is why the new phone has been given its “9” name. Most reports suggest that it will use a 4.7-inch LCD display and is expected to bring back the old home button – which was excluded from Apple’s smartphones when it launched its iPhone X. However, another report has suggested that Apple will remove the home button from the original iPhone 8 design to make room for a larger screen. This screen would span 5.4 inches. The same report also suggests that the iPhone 9 will include Face ID but not Touch ID – the inverse of what was suggested in earlier reports. Analysts are unclear whether the iPhone 9 will have a single-lens camera like the iPhone 8, or will upgrade the camera system to one that uses two lenses. Either way, the camera is expected to offer significantly improved performance compared to the iPhone 8. Reports have also suggest that the camera’s LED flash will be updated to better serve users. PhoneArena believes that the iPhone 9’s camera will offer similar performance to that of the iPhone 11, although it will lack an ultra-wide option. Reports all state that the iPhone 9 will sport Apple’s latest A13 Bionic chipset. However, while analyst Ming-Chi Kuo believes the iPhone 9 will have 3GB of RAM, GSMArena reports that the device will offer 4GB. Kuo also believes the iPhone 9 will come in 64GB and 128GB storage versions. The analyst has also predicted that Apple will launch four iPhones that support 5G – although the cheapest two of these four devices – which would presumably include the iPhone 9 – will not offer mmWave 5G, but sub-6GHz 5G. For markets that do not yet have 5G networks, Apple will reportedly offer smartphones that don’t support this technology. These versions will cost less than their 5G counterparts. Kuo has predicted that the iPhone 9 will be priced from $399, making it an attractive option for users who want a cheaper iPhone. The analyst further predicted that this iPhone will be highly successful due to the low price point. “We estimate iPhone SE2 shipments in 2020 will reach 30-40 million units,” said Kuo. This is a significant figure, as Kuo has also predicted that Apple will sell a total of 80-85 million smartphones in this period. This means the iPhone 9 would be a popular option compared to the company’s premium devices. The iPhone 9 is set to launch in March 2020 in three colours – silver, space grey, and red – according to the reports. Renders of the iPhone 9 – which have a home button and a single camera lens – from OnLeaks below are shown below. <img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-335522" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Render-of-4.7-inch-iPhone-2020-scaled-1-640x360.jpg" alt="Render-of-4.7-inch-iPhone-2020-scaled" width="640" height="360" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Render-of-4.7-inch-iPhone-2020-scaled-1-640x360.jpg 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Render-of-4.7-inch-iPhone-2020-scaled-1-600x338.jpg 600w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Render-of-4.7-inch-iPhone-2020-scaled-1-768x432.jpg 768w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Render-of-4.7-inch-iPhone-2020-scaled-1-1536x864.jpg 1536w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Render-of-4.7-inch-iPhone-2020-scaled-1-2048x1152.jpg 2048w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Render-of-4.7-inch-iPhone-2020-scaled-1-1200x675.jpg 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> <img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-335524" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/2020-iPhone-SE-2-comes-with-better-cameras-and-improved-battery-scaled-1-640x360.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="360" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/2020-iPhone-SE-2-comes-with-better-cameras-and-improved-battery-scaled-1-640x360.jpg 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/2020-iPhone-SE-2-comes-with-better-cameras-and-improved-battery-scaled-1-600x338.jpg 600w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/2020-iPhone-SE-2-comes-with-better-cameras-and-improved-battery-scaled-1-768x432.jpg 768w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/2020-iPhone-SE-2-comes-with-better-cameras-and-improved-battery-scaled-1-1536x864.jpg 1536w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/2020-iPhone-SE-2-comes-with-better-cameras-and-improved-battery-scaled-1-2048x1152.jpg 2048w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/2020-iPhone-SE-2-comes-with-better-cameras-and-improved-battery-scaled-1-1200x675.jpg 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> <img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-335526" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/2020-iPhone-SE-2-4.7-LCD-display-scaled-1-640x360.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="360" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/2020-iPhone-SE-2-4.7-LCD-display-scaled-1-640x360.jpg 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/2020-iPhone-SE-2-4.7-LCD-display-scaled-1-600x338.jpg 600w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/2020-iPhone-SE-2-4.7-LCD-display-scaled-1-768x432.jpg 768w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/2020-iPhone-SE-2-4.7-LCD-display-scaled-1-1536x864.jpg 1536w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/2020-iPhone-SE-2-4.7-LCD-display-scaled-1-2048x1152.jpg 2048w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/2020-iPhone-SE-2-4.7-LCD-display-scaled-1-1200x675.jpg 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> <img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-335528" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/2020-iPhone-SE-2-Frosted-Glass-Back-scaled-1-640x360.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="360" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/2020-iPhone-SE-2-Frosted-Glass-Back-scaled-1-640x360.jpg 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/2020-iPhone-SE-2-Frosted-Glass-Back-scaled-1-600x338.jpg 600w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/2020-iPhone-SE-2-Frosted-Glass-Back-scaled-1-768x432.jpg 768w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/2020-iPhone-SE-2-Frosted-Glass-Back-scaled-1-1536x864.jpg 1536w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/2020-iPhone-SE-2-Frosted-Glass-Back-scaled-1-2048x1152.jpg 2048w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/2020-iPhone-SE-2-Frosted-Glass-Back-scaled-1-1200x675.jpg 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" />
