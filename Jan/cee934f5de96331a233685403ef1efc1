LG Electronics has launched a new head office and factory in South Africa. The South Korean electronics giant’s new local headquarters was officially opened in Midrand on 24 January. LG President for the Middle East and Africa James Lee said the company wants to grow its exposure and range in the local market. “We are positive about our future in South Africa and opportunities within the wider SADEC region, so we have moved our sales and marketing office into Midrand to be our key business hub,” Lee said. The office houses LG’s local call centre and service centre academy, where training for general repair of LG appliances will be available. To show off a range of LG’s top consumer and business products, the premises also boasts a new LG shop. This shop will offer visitors the chance to experience LG’s artificial intelligence-based home solutions, display technologies, and air-conditioning offerings. The company has also moved its factory from Germiston to Durban. The new facility was opened on 24 January and will be used primarily for the assembly of LG’s home entertainment and screen products for distribution in South Africa and the broader SADEC region. President of LG Electronics South Africa DeukSoo Ahn said that Durban is an important trade port and logistics hub. “Moving our factory and warehousing to the coast improves accessibility and efficiency in terms of our supply chains and positions us well for the export market,” Ahn said. Ahn commended the co-operation of local authorities in the establishment of its Durban factory. “We’ve enjoyed great support from local government in setting up our Durban operations, including from the DTI, eThekwini Municipality and Invest Durban. There are so many reasons this makes business sense for us and we look forward to the benefits this repositioning will yield,” Ahn said.
