WeBuyCars has reached some exciting milestones in the year 2019 and proudly ended the year with the opening of their brand new Cape Town branch. Over the past 12 months, WeBuyCars has opened five new branches and is planning to continue its exponential growth in the years to come. The new Cape Town branch already started to trade in December 2019 and will celebrate its grand opening on the 16th of January 2020. For more than 20 years, WeBuyCars continued to experience excessive growth in numerous areas and, in order to keep up with the publicâ€™s growing demand for their services, they had to continuously move to bigger premises. However, for the first time WeBuyCars took on the challenge to design and build their very own warehouse from scratch. With the help of several entities, they were able to create, materialise and open their new Cape Town branch within one year. WeBuyCars originally had two branches in Montague Drive, Cape Town but the new branch will replace one of the existing branches (which was located in Montague Gardens). The new branch will now be located at 1 Dove Street, Brackenfell Common. The Cape Town branch in Phumelela Park will however continue to trade, allowing you to visit them at either of the two WeBuyCars branches to buy your next car or to get a vehicle evaluation and possibly sell your car. With the help of their qualified buyers and sales executives, you will also be able to trade in your vehicle at the branch As with all WeBuyCars branches, their new Cape Town branch has the following value added services available in-house: If you would like to view all the vehicles WeBuyCars currently has available, you can visit their website and have the opportunity to enquire about any vehicle you are interested in.
