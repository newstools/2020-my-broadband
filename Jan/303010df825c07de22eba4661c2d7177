Eskom will implement stage 2 load-shedding across South Africa from 01:00 to 06:00 tomorrow morning, 8 January 2020. The state-owned company stated that it will only implement the load-shedding during the early hours of 8 January so as to not interrupt the announcement of the 2019 matric results. The matric results announcement takes place this evening, 7 January, from 18:00. “This decision will also allow the matriculants enough time to make their way home safely,” said Eskom. “Owing to a loss of additional generation capacity, emergency reserves had to be extensively utilised to supplement capacity during the day,” said Eskom. “These now need to be replenished to meet tomorrow’s electricity demand.” Eskom went on to state that breakdowns are currently at 13,600MW. “Owing to inadequate maintenance over a number of years, the system remains vulnerable to unplanned outages,” said Eskom. The tweet below from Eskom contains today’s load-shedding announcement. #POWERALERT 2
