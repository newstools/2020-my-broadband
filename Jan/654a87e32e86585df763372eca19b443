Eskom announced that it will implement stage 2 load-shedding from 21:00 on Wednesday 8 January until 08:00 on Thursday 9 January. The power utility said that it was forced to use up emergency reserves to supplement capacity during the day due to a loss of additional generation capacity. “In order to minimise the impact of load-shedding on South Africans, load-shedding is scheduled at night to maximise electricity availability during the working day,” Eskom said. “The power system remains vulnerable and unpredictable with breakdowns (UCLF) sitting at 13,543MW as of 16:30.” Eskom said that in the event of further generation unit failure, load-shedding may be implemented during the day tomorrow. “Our teams continue to work tirelessly to return units back from planned and unplanned outages,” the power utility said. “Owing to inadequate maintenance over a number of years, the system remains vulnerable to unplanned power outages.” Eskom added that load-shedding was an essential and controlled measure to protect the power system from total collapse, and urged customers to reduce demand to aid in lowering the level of load-shedding. “We will keep South Africans informed about the status of the electricity system and our recovery effort,” the company said. #POWERALERT 2Date: 08 January 2020 Eskom to implement Stage 2 loadshedding from 21:00 this evening until 08:00 tomorrow morning @SABCNewsOnline @ewnupdates @IOL @eNCA @TimesLIVE @News24 @TheCitizen_News @SowetanLIVE @CityPowerJhb @City_Ekurhuleni @CityTshwane @eThekwiniM pic.twitter.com/3Tyqk4DUeG — Eskom Hld SOC Ltd (@Eskom_SA) January 8, 2020
