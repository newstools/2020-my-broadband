GoDaddy has acquired South Africa-based startup Over. Over runs a popular app which lets users create and edit visual content for online platforms and is intended specifically to help entrepreneurs and small businesses grow their brands. It has over a million monthly active users from more than 150 countries and was awarded Apple’s Best of 2019 App Trend of the Year. Users have access to a library of hand-curated, professionally-designed templates and layout for easy creation and customisation of content on their smartphone. This content can then be shared on social media platforms like Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, and Pinterest, or used in email marketing campaigns and on websites. GoDaddy said that the acquisition of Over will benefit the company’s vision of empowering small business owners. “Over will help bolster GoDaddy’s focus on enabling small business owners to look great everywhere online that matters via its Websites + Marketing product, giving customers a simple yet powerful mobile tool for creating visual content that drives awareness and engagement online with customers and prospects,” GoDaddy said. Over CEO and co-founder Matt Winn said that the Over app and GoDaddy’s website and marketing tools make a powerful combination. “With our combined products, everyday entrepreneurs can go from an idea to a successful online presence faster than ever before,” he said. GoDaddy confirmed that Over will still be available as a standalone app on the Apple App Store and Google Play Store. Financial details of the transaction were not disclosed. GoDaddy said it would maintain Over’s office in Cape Town.
