2019 saw great improvements in the PC gaming market – impressive new graphics cards and processors were released along with high-end desktop processors that boasted more cores and threads than ever before. There were also a variety of popular video game releases – including Resident Evil 2 and the PC version of Red Dead Redemption 2. 2020 promises even more PC gaming announcements which could bring big changes to the platform. Here is what you can expect to make waves in the PC gaming scene this year. Google’s game-streaming service was launched on 19 November and is likely to gain substantially more market share in 2020 when it launches a free plan. Google has the resources to create a truly high-quality product, meaning Stadia is a gaming platform to keep an eye on. Google Stadia is currently available in numerous countries spanning North America and Europe, but many South Africans hope the service will soon receive local servers. Many Stadia fans also hope for the service to become available on more mobile devices, as it is currently only compatible with Google’s Pixel 2, 3, 3a, and 4 smartphones. <img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-328043" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Google-Stadia--640x430.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="430" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Google-Stadia-.jpg 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Google-Stadia--595x400.jpg 595w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Google-Stadia--300x202.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> Next Unit of Computing (NUC) is a technology developed by Intel that could drastically change the future of computing. NUC foregoes the user’s need for a traditional motherboard. Instead, it integrates the processor and various other ports and connections into a smaller box. Computers can still be run with powerful hardware such as high-performance graphics cards, power supplies, and SSDs. Razer recently released its first desktop gaming PC – The Razer Tomahawk – which uses the NUC form factor. It is a high-performance gaming PC which offers up to an Intel Core i9 9th-generation processor, 64GB RAM, and an Nvidia GeForce RTX 2080 Super GPU. <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-334450" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Razer-Tomahawk.png" alt="Razer Tomahawk" width="640" height="431" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Razer-Tomahawk.png 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Razer-Tomahawk-594x400.png 594w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Razer-Tomahawk-300x202.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> 2020 will see a selection of exciting game launches for PC.

Other games that will pique the interest of PC gamers include Nioh 2, Doom Eternal, and Ori and the Will of the Wisps.
