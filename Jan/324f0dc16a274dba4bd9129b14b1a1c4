Dell has unveiled its new XPS 13, a laptop designed to achieve “the most premium and superior computing experience with the finest materials”. Dell said the laptop is smaller and has a thinner profile, but a larger display, than its predecessor. “Elegantly crafted with machined aluminum, carbon fibre, woven glass fibre, and hardened Corning Gorilla Glass, the XPS 13 has a flawless finish in a durable, lightweight design,” said Dell. Dell said the display on the new XPS 13 is a unique engineering feat, with narrow bezels on every side that reduce its InfinityEdge borders and create a smaller and thinner form factor. With a 16:10 aspect ratio, the new display offers more screen space. “And holding true to what XPS fans love most, this new design delivers a 13.4-inch display in an 11-inch form factor – fitting neatly on an airplane tray.” The top-of-the-range unit features a 3,840 x 2,400 (UHD+) touch display, while Full HD options are also available. The company has packed the latest hardware into the laptop, too, and the XPS 13 comes with Intel’s 10-generation Core processors. Core i3, i5, and i7 CPUs are on offer – with the most powerful option the Intel Core i7-1065G7. Graphics options are Intel UHD or Iris Plus, while users are able to install up to 32GB 3,733MHz LPDDR4x RAM. Up to 2TB of PCIe SSD storage can then be fitted, while the entry-level laptop features 256GB of storage space. On the software side, the XPS 13 also offers users the choice between Windows 10 or Ubuntu 18.04LTS, with the latter installed in the Developer Edition of the laptop. Dell said the pricing and availability of the new XPS 13 is as follows: <img class="aligncenter wp-image-333778 size-large" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Dell-4-640x427.jpg" alt="Dell XPS" width="640" height="427" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Dell-4-640x427.jpg 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Dell-4-600x400.jpg 600w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Dell-4-768x512.jpg 768w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Dell-4.jpg 900w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> <img class="aligncenter wp-image-333774 size-large" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Dell-2-640x373.jpg" alt="Dell XPS" width="640" height="373" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Dell-2-640x373.jpg 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Dell-2-600x349.jpg 600w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Dell-2-768x447.jpg 768w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Dell-2.jpg 850w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> <img class="aligncenter wp-image-333776" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Dell-3.jpg" alt="Dell XPS" width="640" height="496" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Dell-3.jpg 834w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Dell-3-516x400.jpg 516w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Dell-3-555x430.jpg 555w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Dell-3-768x595.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" />
