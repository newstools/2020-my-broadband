Eskom did not apply to the National Energy Regulator of South Africa (NERSA) for R1.8 billion to pay performance bonuses, the electricity utility has stated. “In keeping with a board decision reflecting the poor performance of the business, no performance bonuses have been paid to employees in the past two years,” stated Eskom. Eskom issued the statement in response to an article published in the City Press on Sunday, which the power utility said was inaccurate. “The MYPD4 application made by Eskom for the three year period did not include any allocation for performance bonuses,” Eskom said. “The application included a provision for an annual bonus for the three year period, which is equivalent to a 13th cheque which forms part of the Eskom basic conditions of service and cost to company.” The 13th cheques are part of employees’ normal remuneration packages, said Eskom. Non-union employees can choose to structure their package to provide for a 13th cheque without increasing their overall compensation. “NERSA in its decision incorrectly disallowed these contractual costs and hence they do not form part of the allowed revenue granted to Eskom,” the utility said. “Separately, Eskom has lodged a court application to review NERSA’s fourth multi-year price determination (MYPD 4) decision to deduct the R69 billion that government has provided to Eskom as shareholder support. The court application does not include any other aspects of the MYPD4 decision. This case will be heard in court next week.”
