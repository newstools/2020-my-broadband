Frogfoot has announced that it is rolling out fibre infrastructure in Polokwane. Bendor Park and Welgelegen have both gone live, the fibre network provider said, with over 600 homes currently being covered in these areas. However, Frogfoot said this makes up just 10% of its total planned fibre coverage in the city. “Frogfoot is expanding in these towns as they meet our criteria in terms of the number of houses that can be connected, as well as the average household income in these areas,” said Frogfoot head of sales Shane Chorley. “While we are looking primarily at the consumer market, there are opportunities to target certain types of smaller businesses that are based in and around the residential areas.” Chorley said that users from smaller towns are data-starved, and fibre connectivity will change how they can use the Internet. “It might take a while, but as people become exposed to the possibilities of quality high-speed Internet, they consume far more data than before.” Frogfoot said that schools within the coverage area can apply for a fibre link, which will give these schools access to a free FTTH connection of up to 1Gbps as part of Frogfoot’s schools promotion campaign. The company said its strategy to roll out fibre to secondary towns in South African also includes the expansion into Bloemfontein, East London, Ermelo, Middelburg, Pietermaritzburg, Richards Bay, and Witbank.
