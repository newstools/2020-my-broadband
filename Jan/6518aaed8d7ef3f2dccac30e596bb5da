Arrive Alive recently released its advice to drivers for navigating South African roads during load-shedding. “There is not much that the average person can do about power failures affecting traffic lights and traffic flow – the correct driving attitude can, however, go a long way in preventing collisions,” said Arrive Alive. “It is suggested, where possible, that drivers plan their routes and leave early to try and avoid the heavy traffic periods.” Arrive Alive warned drivers to be extra cautious when the power is out because people may be distracted or impatient. “Many people are impatient because they are late due to the above-mentioned conditions and may take unnecessary risks,” said Arrive Alive. “Many other motorists are also stuck or delayed and may be using their cellphones and possibly not concentrating fully on the road.” Arrive Alive’s driving advice for specific scenarios during load-shedding is below.
