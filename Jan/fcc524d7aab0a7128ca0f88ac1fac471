A driver has recorded themselves hitting 309km/h on the N1 in Gauteng, sparking strong criticism on social media. Media consultant and anti-crime activist Yusuf Abramjee posted the video, calling the act “sheer madness”. The video shows the driver’s dashboard and speedometer, with the vehicle’s speed increasing from just over 240km/h to a peak speed of 309km/h. It appears he is driving a high-end Audi. Gauteng Traffic Police said “these are criminals who arrogantly show off as no one will expose their identity and provide evidence or witness testimony that will result in conviction”. It added that a previous speeding incident on the R21 highway which involved a motorbike could not result in a conviction as “nobody has spilled the beans and no plates were visible on camera”. Social media comments regarding the speedster were mixed, with people slating it as irresponsible and criminal – while others defended the driver’s actions. “If I had that car, I might probably test it on that road. That road is safe and it’s at night,” said one commentator. “You are all mad because you won’t be able to keep up. Whoever is behind the wheel is a legend,” said another. “This driver is sick and stupid. The highway has surveillance cameras. He will be picked up by the cops,” one person said. “Endangering other people’s lives for a thrill. What happens when he suddenly has to brake and the car skids or rolls into another car on the opposite carriageway. Stupid fool,” said another.
