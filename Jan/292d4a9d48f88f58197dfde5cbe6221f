Apple is reportedly working on a “Pro Mode” which could increase performance on MacBooks upon activation. The discovery was made by 9to5Mac, which noticed lines of code in the macOS Catalina 10.15.3 beta build referring to the feature. The code implies that the Pro Mode feature can be manually turned on or off by the user. The code also includes strings such as “Apps may run faster, but battery life may decrease and fan noise may increase” and “Fan speed limit overridden”. These are messages that will supposedly be displayed to the user when they activate the feature. 9to5Mac said that since this coding is directly related to the OS’s power management system, users will be able to gain a performance boost while the system ignores restrictions that assist with power saving. The increased fan speed should also help to avoid thermal throttling. It added that Pro Mode appears configured to automatically disable itself after one day, similar to the Do Not Disturb Mode. 9to5Mac said there is some evidence that the feature will only be available on the new 16-inch MacBook Pro. This could be due to the updated thermal design present in recently-unveiled MacBook models The screenshot below is from 9to5Mac and shows the code relating to Pro Mode. <img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-335086" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Apple-Pro-Mode-640x109.png" alt="Apple Pro Mode" width="640" height="109" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Apple-Pro-Mode-640x109.png 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Apple-Pro-Mode-600x102.png 600w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Apple-Pro-Mode-768x131.png 768w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Apple-Pro-Mode-1536x262.png 1536w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Apple-Pro-Mode-1200x205.png 1200w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Apple-Pro-Mode.png 1874w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" />
