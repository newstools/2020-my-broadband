Lenovo has revealed its new ThinkPad X1 series of flagship laptops. The company has made updates to its previous generation of X1 models, which were launched in June 2019, and the latest range is now the 8th-generation. Lenovo also unveiled its 5th-generation of ThinkPad X1 Yoga convertible laptops, which feature a similar exterior design to their predecessors. The laptops offer similar component support but will allow for double the amount of storage, with a new maximum capacity of 2TB. Six-core, 10th-generation Core i7 CPUs and 16GB of LPDDR3 RAM are additional new features for the devices. Lenovo has added several new features to take note of, however. Firstly, the 2020 laptops offer Wi-Fi 6 support, which can help to make wireless connectivity much faster. Additionally, Lenovo has added a set of buttons to the keyboard for instant voice-over-IP access. A much-punted new feature by Lenovo is the option of a 1080p PrivacyGuard screen, which helps to keep your display hidden from bystanders or prying eyes with an extremely narrow viewing angle. Users no longer have to sacrifice viewing ability for privacy, though, as Lenovo has doubled the peak brightness of the display to 500 nits. In addition, the ThinkPad’s PrivacyAlert feature uses the webcam to notify the laptop’s user if a person may be peering over their shoulder. Lenovo did not announce a release date for the ThinkPad X1 range, but the laptops will be available during 2020. The ThinkPad X1 Carbon starts at a price of $1,499, while the ThinkPad X1 Yoga will begin at $1,599. The tables below show the specifications of the new Lenovo ThinkPad X1 Carbon and ThinkPad X1 Yoga. <img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-333980" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Lenovo-ThinkPad-X1-640x430.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="430" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Lenovo-ThinkPad-X1.jpeg 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Lenovo-ThinkPad-X1-595x400.jpeg 595w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Lenovo-ThinkPad-X1-300x202.jpeg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> <img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-333982" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Lenovo-ThinkPad-X1-Yoga-640x430.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="430" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Lenovo-ThinkPad-X1-Yoga.jpeg 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Lenovo-ThinkPad-X1-Yoga-595x400.jpeg 595w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Lenovo-ThinkPad-X1-Yoga-300x202.jpeg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" />
