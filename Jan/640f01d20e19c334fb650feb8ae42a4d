Samsung’s second foldable smartphone has been shown to a secret meeting of CES 2020 attendees, TechRadar reports. The device, which will allegedly be named the Samsung Galaxy Bloom, reportedly uses a clamshell folding design similar design to that of the new Motorola Razr. A report by South Korean publication Aju News claimed that unlike the Samsung Galaxy Fold, the Bloom will not have a plastic screen. Instead, it will use a special type of glass which has been dubbed Ultra-Thin Glass (UTG). According to the report, Samsung CEO DJ Koh said the phone’s style draws inspiration from Lancôme, a French cosmetics company, which is known for its foldable compact cases. This aligns with a report by SAMMobile, which claims the clamshell design was chosen to be attractive to a younger female audience. The specifications of the Galaxy Bloom are not yet known. The Galaxy Bloom will be the second foldable smartphone to be launched by Samsung, following the release of the Galaxy Fold last year. Samsung Electronics president Young Sohn claimed in December that the company has already sold 1 million Galaxy Fold smartphones. However, Koh has since clarified that the company has only sold between 400,000 and 500,000 of the foldable devices.
