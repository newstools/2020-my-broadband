According to a post by the CIPC on Twitter, the CIPC’s systems are offline due to maintenance. The maintenance is running from 24-26 January.  The Companies and Intellectual Property Commission’s (CIPC) website is offline and cannot be reached. MyBroadband was alerted to the issue by a reader, who stated that the “CIPC site seems to have vanished from the Internet”. “[I] had a few clients query why they couldn’t access it, so we checked up on it,” said the reader. When MyBroadband attempted to visit the site, it received a “site can’t be reached” message in Chrome. The message added that the cipc.co.za’s server IP address could not be found. Pinging the cipc.co.za address also resulted in the request timing out. The CIPC’s eServices portal – eservices.cipc.co.za – was also down at the time of writing. Follow-up checks on the CIPC resulted in the following: The CIPC was asked for comment on the matter, but did not reply by the time of publication. <img class="aligncenter wp-image-336348 size-large" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Website-640x316.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="316" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Website-640x316.jpg 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Website-600x296.jpg 600w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Website-768x379.jpg 768w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Website-1536x757.jpg 1536w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Website-1200x592.jpg 1200w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Website.jpg 1718w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> <img class="aligncenter wp-image-336346 size-large" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/eServices-640x316.jpg" alt="eServices" width="640" height="316" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/eServices-640x316.jpg 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/eServices-600x296.jpg 600w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/eServices-768x379.jpg 768w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/eServices-1536x757.jpg 1536w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/eServices-1200x592.jpg 1200w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/eServices.jpg 1718w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" />
