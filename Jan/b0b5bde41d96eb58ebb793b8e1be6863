Rain has doubled its 5G coverage over the last two months and now offers the service in many parts of Gauteng. Rain launched its commercial 5G service on 11 November 2019, offering subscribers unlimited data at speeds of up to 700Mbps for R1,000 per month. At the time, Rain had 250 5G towers providing coverage to an estimated 500,000 households in Johannesburg and Tshwane. The company said it was able to double its 5G coverage since launch, which was achieved by adding more sites and providing a new 5G router to users. Rain’s Chief Marketing Officer Khaya Dlanga said the latest version of Rain’s 5G router can be used both indoors and outdoors. He added that Rain is planning to expand its 5G coverage to Cape Town and Durban in 2020. The table below provides an overview of the suburbs in Gauteng where Rain has 5G coverage.
