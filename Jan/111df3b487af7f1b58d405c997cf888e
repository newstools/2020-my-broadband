The speeding motorist who hit 309km/h on the N1 has been identified and has been advised to come forward. The driver made headlines after recording themself hitting 309km/h on the N1 in Gauteng, sparking strong criticism on social media. Media consultant and anti-crime activist Yusuf Abramjee posted the video, calling the act “sheer madness”. The video shows the driver’s dashboard and speedometer, with the vehicle’s speed increasing from just over 240km/h to a peak speed of 309km/h. Gauteng Traffic Police said “these are criminals who arrogantly show off as no one will expose their identity and provide evidence or witness testimony that will result in conviction”. It added that a previous speeding incident on the R21 highway which involved a motorbike could not result in a conviction as “nobody has spilled the beans and no plates were visible on camera”. The Road Traffic Management Corporation (RTMC) said the driver has been identified by traffic authorities. The RTMC said the driver “must come forward and present himself or we will visit him at his place of residence in Midrand”.
