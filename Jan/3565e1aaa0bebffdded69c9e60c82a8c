Rain is selling telecommunications business Broadlink to CipherWave, the company confirmed to MyBroadband. Rain CEO Willem Roos said that the sale is in progress, and added that Rain believes approval from the Competition Commission is not required. Spectrum licences are not included in this transaction, and Broadlink staff will remain unaffected, he said. CipherWave is a South African ISP which provides businesses with a range of connectivity options. The company also owns the Home-Connect consumer ISP, which provides fibre Internet services. Multisource completed its acquisition of WBS (now Rain) in 2015, which was the parent company of iBurst and Broadlink at the time. The business held on to Broadlink through its re-branding, but it is now disposing the company to CipherWave. Roos did not provide any additional information regarding the value of the deal. In addition to its 4G mobile data products, Rain also offers South Africa’s first consumer 5G product as a fixed-wireless service. The company plans to grow the reach of this service aggressively going forward, expanding the coverage of both of its networks. While the large part of Rain’s 4G towers is managed by Vodacom, its 5G towers are all rolled out by the company itself. Rain plans to have 5,000 4G sites and 700 5G sites in South Africa by the end of 2020.
