Those interested can join them for this webinar on 3 June 2020, when Dr Andre Fourie*, Poynting Group CEO, will be presenting this subject that has been a passion for many years. Have a look at the video below for a quick overview on what to expect. <span data-mce-type="bookmark" style="display: inline-block; width: 0px; overflow: hidden; line-height: 0;" class="mce_SELRES_start">﻿</span> There is a huge money saving opportunity for mobile operators in using outdoor antennas as part of a Fixed Wireless Access (FWA) solution. Normally operators only consider outdoor antennas as a solution to fix signal problems for customers on the fringe of reception, but in this webinar Poynting will show that there is a real business case for a MNO to save money when using outdoor antennas as part of their FWA solution. This is one of the rare occasions when a technical approach can solve a business problem. An operator can get much more revenue from the same infrastructure, as they can increase the capacity of a base station by a factor of 4 or 5, by adding outdoor antennas to their solution.
