Silicon Overdrive recently announced that AWS awarded them the distinguished AWS DevOps competency. The DevOps competency signifies that Silicon Overdrive has demonstrated the required expertise, and has excelled, in implementing DevOps practices such as code pipelines, CI/CD and automated infrastructure provisioning. “Silicon Overdrive is delighted that Amazon Web Services has awarded us with the AWS DevOps competency,” said Gareth Bowers, CEO of Silicon Overdrive. “By utilising DevOps methodologies, we can streamline deployments and the migration of workloads; all with an emphasis on security and best practices.” Attaining this competency required a stringent audit with an independent third-party auditor to verify Silicon Overdrive’s technical and business development capabilities. This included case studies of production workloads utilising DevOps methodologies and in-depth technical demonstrations of the AWS DevOps suite of tools and services.
