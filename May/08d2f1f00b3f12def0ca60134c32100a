iStore has opened pre-orders for the Apple Watch Series 5 GPS + Cellular models. Apple unveiled its Series 5 smartwatch on 10 September 2019, with both a GPS-only and GPS + Cellular version released. The GPS + Cellular models include built-in eSIM (embedded SIM) support, which allows the smartwatch to connect to mobile networks and and use mobile data without the need to connect to a smartphone. Users are able to make phone calls, send messages, and stream music directly from their watch. iStore said in its pre-order mailer that the eSIM functionality will be available exclusively on Vodacom’s network. Vodacom’s eSIM service is called OneNumber and allows customers to use the same number as on their smartphones which use a physical SIM. To use OneNumber, subscribers must link their device to Vodacom and pay R25 per month for the eSIM service. The operator also offers the service to owners of Samsung’s latest Galaxy Watch with LTE capabilities. Until now, only the GPS variant of the Apple Watch Series 5 has been available in South Africa. Pricing for the Apple Watch Series 5 GPS + Cellular starts at R12,499. The table below details the pre-order pricing from iStore.
