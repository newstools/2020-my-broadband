Grand Theft Auto V (GTA V) is now free for all PC gamers. Those looking to claim their copy can redeem it from the Epic Games Store until 21 May. In a now-deleted tweet from Wednesday evening, Epic Games revealed GTA V would be free to download for PC and keep “forever”. The game became available for free from the store at 17:00 on Thursday afternoon. Only minutes after this, a large influx of users trying to download the title resulted in issues on the Epic Games Store. The impact of the traffic was so severe, it appeared to be affecting users playing other Epic Games titles, including Fortnite. GTA V is one of the best-selling video games of all time, second only to Minecraft. Over 120 million copies of the game have been sold since its launch on consoles in September 2019. Players take on the role of one of three criminals as they set out to commit heists while under pressure from a government agency and powerful crime figures. You can travel by foot or vehicle as you explore the huge California-inspired fictional world of San Andreas. To redeem your free copy of GTA V, you will need to have an Epic Games account and access to the store via the desktop launcher or mobile app. If you don’t have the Epic Games launcher installed, click here to download it for Windows or Mac. The store is also available via an app for Android and iOS. Once your account is set up, search for “GTA 5” in the store and click on the game icon to redeem it. Once this is done, you will be able to download and play the game at any time in the future. GTA V was recently removed from Microsoft’s Xbox Game Pass subscription for Xbox consoles. However, it was replaced with another popular Rockstar title – Red Dead Redemption 2. This is great news for Xbox console owners, who are now able to play Red Dead Redemption 2 and over 100 other titles for R99 per month.
