These container-like boxes are placed so that people have to walk through them before entering a building, and they spray inhabitants with a sanitising spraying solution which kills the virus and disinfects anybody passing through. A Spar Express store in Mbombela recently rolled out one of these Anti-Vi installations at their entrance. The company which makes the equipment said the solution has been approved by the European Safety Authority as safe for human use. Several other variants of disinfection tunnels are also being manufactured in South Africa, including the SpraySafe, manufactured by Jachris, and another tunnel built by Afriten Technologies.
