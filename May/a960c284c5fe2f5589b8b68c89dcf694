South Africa’s extended lockdown is starting to impact the economy, with National Treasury expecting job losses, tax losses, and a contracting economy. National Treasury’s director-general Dondo Mogajane warned the country’s economy could contract by as much as 16.1% this year. The contraction will depend on how long it takes to contain the coronavirus pandemic and for the economy to recover. South Africa also stands to lose up to 7 million jobs, depending on the speed of the country’s economic recovery. Mogajane said South Africa therefore has to move quickly to get the economy back to normal, while containing the impact of the virus. Two of the lockdown regulations which have resulted in the most criticism and unhappiness are the ban on alcohol and cigarette sales. Apart from the lack of support from many citizens, it is also costing the country a lot of money in lost tax revenue. SARS Commissioner Edward Kieswetter said the losses in tax revenue from beer and alcohol in April were: “So, year to date, our under recovery from these activities is R1.5 billion and we’re just through the first month,” said Kieswetter. Considering the negativity about the ban and the loss in tax revenues, it is not surprising that Finance Minister Tito Mboweni does not support this decision. Mboweni said he would have allowed the sale of alcoholic beverages and tobacco products under level 4 to resume if it was his choice. An area which has drawn sharp criticism from industry is the restrictions placed on ecommerce and deliveries. While many other countries allowed unfettered ecommerce because of the contactless nature of the industry, this did not happen in South Africa. Online shops are only allowed to sell the products which brick-and-mortar shops are allowed to sell. Minister for Trade and Industry Ebrahim Patel said that ecommerce will continue to operate under restrictions due to concerns over fair competition. “If we open up any one category, let’s say ecommerce, unavoidably there’s enormous pressure to do the same for physical stores,” Patel stated. Ecommerce companies have a different view. Takealot CEO Kim Reid said online stores should be able to sell all items as it allows people to buy goods in an almost completely contactless way. “Social distancing is built into ecommerce,” Reid said, adding that with a few simple delivery protocols, ecommerce allows for a very hygienic way of shopping. He said South Africa’s ecommerce companies are an asset in the fight against the coronavirus that the government should be using. One restriction which is making many South Africans unhappy is only being allowed to exercise outside between 06:00 and 09:00. This has resulted in large crowds flocking to popular walking and jogging spots like the Sea Point promenade and the Durban beachfront at the same time. Former FNB CEO Michael Jordaan highlighted that the sun rises at 06:31 in Johannesburg and only at 07:21 in Cape Town. “The regulations are not thought through,” he said. Western Cape Premier Alan Winde said the regulations are causing congestion and needed to be re-thought. He said exercise is essential for health and lockdown regulations should not be making it a luxury. He added that essential workers may not have the ability to exercise between 06:00 and 09:00, and they should also be accommodated. He suggested having morning and afternoon sessions when people are allowed to walk, jog, or cycle outside. Constitutional expert Pierre de Vos said ministers should provide proper, fact-based and rational justifications for every lockdown regulation they seek to impose. “Matters will be made worse if the government decides to use the police and the military to try to impose its will by force in the face of widespread public resistance,” he said. Many people feel many of the ministers are not experts in their field and that some regulations do more harm than good. Here are a few of the regulations which are widely criticized by industry players and citizens. <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-187221" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/13_organise-packages.jpg" alt="organise-packages" width="640" height="400" /> <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-350426" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Sea-Point.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="430" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Sea-Point.jpg 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Sea-Point-595x400.jpg 595w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Sea-Point-300x202.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-350422" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Home-brew.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="430" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Home-brew.jpg 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Home-brew-595x400.jpg 595w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Home-brew-300x202.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-350424" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Cigarettes.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="430" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Cigarettes.jpg 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Cigarettes-595x400.jpg 595w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Cigarettes-300x202.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" />
