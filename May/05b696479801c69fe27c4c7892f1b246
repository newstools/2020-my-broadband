Intel’s new Core i9-10900K boasts impressive overclocking capabilities, according to a report from Video Cardz. It remains to be seen if this feature will play a role in taking on AMD’s top desktop processors, however. Intel officially announced its latest generation of Comet Lake-S desktop processors last week. The range is headlined by the i9-10900K, which the company has called the fastest gaming processor in the world. The fully-unlocked CPU boasts 10 physical cores, 20 threads, a base clock speed of 3.7GHz, and a boost clock of up to 5.3GHz. It was manufactured using a 14nm process and comes with a thermal design power (TDP) of 125W, a substantial increase over the 95W of the previous generation’s i9-9900K. Intel has embargoed reviews of the i9-10900K until 20 May, but this has not stopped those who have managed to get their hands on the processor from testing it. Video Cardz spotted a post on Baidu forums which purportedly showed the processor running on a system with an ASRock Phantom Gaming 4/AX motherboard and G.Skill DDR4-3200MHz CL14 RAM. The user managed to overclock all cores to 5.4GHz, reaching 100MHz higher than the stock-rated boost speed, and 1,700MHz faster than its base clock speed. At this frequency, it achieved a Cinebench R15 multi-core score of 3,002. The original post has since been removed from Baidu. The image below from Video Cardz shows CPU-Z screenshots of the processor’s overclocked specifications and results of the Cinebench R15 multi-core test. <img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-351009" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Intel-Core-i9-10900K-benchmark-Video-Cardz-640x343.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="343" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Intel-Core-i9-10900K-benchmark-Video-Cardz-640x343.jpg 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Intel-Core-i9-10900K-benchmark-Video-Cardz-600x322.jpg 600w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Intel-Core-i9-10900K-benchmark-Video-Cardz-768x412.jpg 768w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Intel-Core-i9-10900K-benchmark-Video-Cardz.jpg 1121w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> <img class="aligncenter wp-image-351013 size-full" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Intel-i9-10900K-Cinebench-multi-core-score_Video-Cardz.jpg" alt="Intel i9-10900K Cinebench multi-core score_Video Cardz" width="640" height="510" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Intel-i9-10900K-Cinebench-multi-core-score_Video-Cardz.jpg 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Intel-i9-10900K-Cinebench-multi-core-score_Video-Cardz-502x400.jpg 502w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Intel-i9-10900K-Cinebench-multi-core-score_Video-Cardz-540x430.jpg 540w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> Intel is up for tough competition from AMD in 2020. AMD’s top desktop processor for mainstream users – the Ryzen 9 Threadripper 3950X – has shown superior scores in several multi-core benchmarks. Despite having lower boost and base clock speeds than Intel’s entry, it boasts 6 additional cores and 12 more threads, as well as a larger cache. VideoCardz previously shared Cinebench R15 benchmark results which found that the 10900K comes out on top in terms of single-core performance, but by a small margin of 4.2%. In multi-core testing, the 3950X posted a more substantial 48.5% increase in performance. Even in its overclocked state, the Intel Core i9-10900K’s score of 3,002 is significantly less than the 3950X’s non-overclocked 3,932. It should be noted that users will have to pay a significant premium for this additional performance. The Intel Core i9-10900K is priced at $488, while the 3950X will set buyers back $749.
