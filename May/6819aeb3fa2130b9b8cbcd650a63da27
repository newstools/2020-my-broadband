This is something which has angered many South Africans, who are calling for the ban to be lifted. Free Market Foundation (FMF) CEO Leon Louw believes that the cigarette ban in South Africa may last until 2021. “Smokers should be prepared to pay R20 for a single cigarette or R200 a box for many months to come,” said Louw. “The pandemic will be with us in some form until next year, so don’t expect tobacco sales to be unbanned before 2021.” Louw told MyBroadband that cooperative governance minister Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma told the National Coronavirus Command Council (NCCC) that the sale of tobacco and alcohol should remain banned until South Africa reaches level 1 of lockdown.
