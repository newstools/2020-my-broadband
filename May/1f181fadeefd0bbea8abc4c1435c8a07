Nedbank has launched a new “super app”, called Avo, which will give the bank’s customers to access online shopping, essential services and financial products on a single platform. The group said the term “super app” refers to the fact that Avo is actually a multitude of apps aggregated into one. Some of the key features of the app include: Because the app launched in the middle of the country’s coronavirus lockdown, Nedbank said the services available through the app are level-5 compliant. It added that the beta version of Avo has already been delivering essential goods, providing home entertainment and connecting home service providers across provinces. While the app was originally trialled by staff, Nedbank said it has now released a beta version to its Nedbank Money App users. “This will see the phased release of Avo to Nedbank clients, to allow for further enhancements before full public launch.” “The beta will allow Nedbank Money App users to use a two-click process to sign up seamlessly onto Avo.” <img class="aligncenter wp-image-352645" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Avo-1.jpg" alt="Avo 1" width="640" height="1386" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Avo-1.jpg 1125w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Avo-1-185x400.jpg 185w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Avo-1-199x430.jpg 199w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Avo-1-768x1663.jpg 768w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Avo-1-709x1536.jpg 709w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Avo-1-946x2048.jpg 946w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> <img class="aligncenter wp-image-352647" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Avo-2.jpg" alt="Avo 2" width="640" height="1386" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Avo-2.jpg 1125w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Avo-2-185x400.jpg 185w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Avo-2-199x430.jpg 199w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Avo-2-768x1663.jpg 768w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Avo-2-709x1536.jpg 709w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Avo-2-946x2048.jpg 946w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> <img class="aligncenter wp-image-352643" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Avo-3.jpg" alt="Avo 3" width="640" height="1386" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Avo-3.jpg 1125w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Avo-3-185x400.jpg 185w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Avo-3-199x430.jpg 199w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Avo-3-768x1663.jpg 768w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Avo-3-709x1536.jpg 709w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Avo-3-946x2048.jpg 946w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" />
