There is one thing most top South African IT and telecommunications companies have in common – they all advertise on MyBroadband. This is no surprise considering MyBroadband’s exceptional reach. In April, it grew its monthly readership to over 3 million unique browsers. What makes this audience attractive to ICT companies is that the majority of these readers are IT and business decision makers in their companies. Over 80% of MyBroadband’s readers also advise their family and friends on which ICT products to buy. MyBroadband’s influence and reach is clearly illustrated by the April 2020 statistics from Narratiive – the official traffic measurement partner of the IAB South Africa. Over the last month, MyBroadband’s readership included 51,826 CEOs and company directors, and 372,164 registered business owners. The publications also attracted 335,225 executives and senior managers, and 1,063,169 IT managers from top companies. Many companies prefer to only reach very specific audiences with their marketing, like CIOs, CTOs, CEOs, IT managers, or SME owners. To address this need, MyBroadband has launched new marketing products which make it possible for companies to reach highly-targeted audiences. A company can now say exactly who they want to reach through a content marketing and social media campaign, and MyBroadband does the rest. The success of these targeted campaigns is proven, and engagement rates were much higher than traditional advertising campaigns.
