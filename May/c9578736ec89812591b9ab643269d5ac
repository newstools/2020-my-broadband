Mkhize said South Africa does not yet meet criteria set out by the WHO as a guideline for determining a country’s readiness to lift restrictions to curb the spread of COVID-19 According to the minister, the rate of new infections was still too high to justify a complete reversal of South Africa’s lockdown measures.
