While the coronavirus pandemic has many working from home, it remains important to plan for the office of tomorrow. It will become increasingly important for your office to have the best wireless connectivity so that both your staff and your systems can complete all necessary tasks optimally. Wi-Fi 6 is set to transform the office by offering high-speed, reliable connectivity – which is already important, and continues to increase in importance as other technologies advance. Huawei continues to lead the market with its AirEngine Wi-Fi 6. This is according to the report on global Wi-Fi 6 indoor AP market share by Dell’Oro Group, which found that Huawei’s Wi-Fi 6 ranked number one in the global market (excluding North America) in the period spanning Q3 2018 to Q3 2019. Huawei has been at the forefront of the technology’s rollout since its inception, and continues to expand its strength in this area. It rolled out the first enterprise-class Wi-Fi network in Shanghai in 2018, and has since implemented its Huawei AirEngine Wi-Fi 6 at scale across countries such as Spain, Italy, Switzerland, Belgium, China, India, and South Africa.
