The lockdown regulations prohibit hotels, lodges, bed and breakfasts, and private homes from offering paid leisure accommodation. South Africa’s tourism industry, which provides jobs for more than 740,000 people, is facing a catastrophe as a result of these restrictions. A survey by Cape Town Tourism found that 59% of travel and tourism businesses expect revenues to fall to zero between April and June. 83% of these businesses also said they would not survive longer than six months under the current lockdown conditions. A further challenge for the industry is that there is no clear path to recovery. 56% of tourism businesses indicated they do not have a recovery plan in place.
