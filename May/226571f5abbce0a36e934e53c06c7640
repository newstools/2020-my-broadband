While it is possible to keep your children at home once schools reopen, there are consequences – including your children being deregistered from their current school. This is according to the South African Teachers Association (SAOU), which has published an answer to the question: Can parents decide not to send their children back to school for fear of COVID-19 infections. According to the South African Schools Act (SASA), parents are obligated to send their children to school from the first school day of the year in which their child reaches the age of seven, until the last school day of the year in which the learner reaches the age of 15 or Grade 9 – whichever comes first. Once children pass this age limit, they are no longer required to go to school by law – and can therefore be withdrawn. However, it is possible for parents to remove children who are of school-going age from their current school and implement homeschooling. Parents who take their children out of school for the rest of 2020 will need to consider the following, said the SAOU: The SAOU advised that should the parents of students who are withdrawn from school want to enroll their children at a public school in 2021, the following considerations must be kept in mind: According to the SAOU, schools may not stop parents from removing their children from schools, but it is necessary that the administrative process is applied. This includes the relevant paperwork, as well as the school discussing the situation with the parents to ensure they have enough information to make an informed decision. If the learner leaves, the school will have no obligation to support the child at home unless the provincial education department’s registration conditions require them to. The SAOU further clarifies that certain cases can be dealt with internally – such as learners with underlying illnesses being allowed to remain enrolled at the school and receive support while remaining at home.
