Microsoft has started rolling out its May 2020 Update – also called the 20H1 update – for Windows 10 PCs. The final build of this update – which takes the OS to Windows 10 version 2004 – has been available for users in the Windows Insider Program’s Release Preview ring since 30 April 2020. A notable new feature in this update is the second version of the Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL 2), which allows for easy access of files stored in Linux distros directly from the Windows Explorer. Microsoft’s virtual assistant – Cortana – has also been revamped with a new interface for typing and speaking requests in natural language. Additionally, users can now use their voice to let Cortana create calendar events, as well as send and view emails to and from specific persons. Microsoft listed a host of other new features available in Windows version 2004. These include the following: Microsoft said the update would be gradually made available to users based on their Windows 10 versions. “To ensure you continue to have a reliable, productive experience with your Windows 10 devices, we are taking a measured and phased approach to how we offer the May Update, initially limiting availability to those devices running Windows 10, versions 1903 and 1909 who seek the update via Windows Update,” the company stated. If you are using one of these versions and want to install the new update, open your Windows Update settings by navigating to Settings, clicking on Update & Security and selecting Windows Update. From here, click “Check for updates” and once the update appears, hit “Download and install”.
