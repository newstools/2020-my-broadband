The Department of Trade, Industry, and Competition has published new regulations which allow unlimited ecommerce in South Africa. The new regulations, published today, state that all goods may be transacted through ecommerce platforms, except for alcohol and tobacco products. These regulations were published a day after President Cyril Ramaphosa said the government will announce changes to level 4 regulations to expand permitted business activities in the retail space and ecommerce. The regulations also include strict rules for ecommerce operations and deliveries. The regulations follow increased pressure on the government to allow unlimited ecommerce in South Africa. Cas Coovadia, CEO of Business for South Africa, has said ecommerce should be opened up “totally” with immediate effect. Allowing people to do their shopping online not only helps ecommerce companies, but will also kickstart courier services and economic activity, he said. SARS commissioner Edward Kieswetter also supports the move, saying ecommerce holds great potential for South Africa and should be opened up. Kieswetter said many people think of ecommerce as a virtual economy – but it opens a full value chain of economic activity. The DA was threatening to take the matter one step further, and launched court action to “end the national hard lockdown that is tearing our society and economy to pieces”. The DA’s lawyers will file papers in the High Court challenging the rationality of the restrictions on ecommerce, and will also challenge the night-time curfew and the 3-hour exercise window.
