Many South Africans may be stuck at home for the foreseeable future due to the COVID-19 pandemic and the restrictions placed on movement. A number of local companies have been allowed to continue operating, however, including mobile networks. Local mobile operators such as Vodacom, MTN, Telkom, and Cell C continue to provide services to customers, although in many cases their physical stores are closed. This means that if you need to make any changes to your cellphone or data package, you can do so online or through your network’s call centre. It is also possible to take out a new cellphone contract with certain mobile operators using an online application process. This process differs between mobile networks, and many have also warned that delivery of SIMs and devices may be delayed due to the restrictions in place under COVID-19 alert level 4. iStore South Africa has stated that if customers wish to take out a new contract or upgrade their existing package, they can do so online and their new device will be delivered as soon as it is available.

Vodacom continues to offer online shopping through its website throughout the duration of the lockdown. “As a core service, our online store and courier service remain operational,” Vodacom states on its website.

Additionally, Vodacom offers free delivery on upgrades, contracts, and prepaid orders over R500. The Vodacom online store lets users select the device they want, sign in with their personal and banking details, and complete the online application. Customers can provide the required documentation directly through the online application process, and once it is completed, their new device will be delivered to their door. Deliveries take place between 08:00 and 17:00 from Monday to Friday, excluding public holidays.
