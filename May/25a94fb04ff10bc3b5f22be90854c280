Telkom is cutting off ADSL and VDSL subscribers across South Africa as part of its strategy to decommission its old copper network. Telkom CEO Sipho Maseko said last year that the company aims to exit the copper segment entirely in the coming years. What this means for ADSL and VDSL subscribers is that they have to look for an alternative broadband service. The preferred option is fibre, which offers numerous benefits over ADSL. These benefits include: Fibre is available in many suburbs across South Africa, but there are certain areas which are not covered. For people living outside of a fibre-covered area, a fixed-LTE connection is a good alternative. Fixed-LTE is quick to install, it provides good speeds, and offers affordable high-data-usage accounts. For people looking to move to fibre, an excellent choice is Supersonic – winner of the Best ISP in South Africa award in 2019. Supersonic offers fibre-to-the-home throughout South Africa and makes it easy to move from ADSL to fibre. People without fibre coverage will have the option to get a Supersonic fixed-LTE connection over MTN’s award-winning network. Supersonic’s fixed-LTE service offers subscribers a fast and reliable Internet service with prices starting from R249 per month.
