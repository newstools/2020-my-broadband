To slow down the spread of Coronavirus and Covid-19, disinfecting surfaces should be a top priority. A quick and easy solution to disinfecting large surfaces in the workplace and at home, is to use a cordless spray gun to spray disinfectant. The cordless spray gun (usually sold as a paint spray gun) is highly effective to spray disinfectant, compared to regular cleaning. It has a comfortable soft grip handle as well as 3 different spray options, one of them being a very fine mist spray, which is ideal for any surface that you may want to disinfect. It is also a lot more efficient than an agricultural sprayer, as it covers an entire surface with a thin layer of disinfectant without leaving untreated patches. Any cordless spray gun will work, EcoDepot recommends the Ryobi XSG-18 Cordless Spray Gun for reliability and value for money. Virol-Oxy is an advanced surface disinfectant which works within minutes and is highly effective against viruses (including coronavirus), bacteria, fungi and spores. It’s a lot more gentle to most surfaces than diluted bleach and you can even use it to wash off some food products. Virol-Oxy is a disinfectant elaborated in Germany. EcoDepot is an authorised distributor of Virol-Oxy in South Africa. Virol-Oxy is also available in bulk 1kg packages, to prepare 100L of disinfectant (1% solution). <span data-mce-type="bookmark" style="display: inline-block; width: 0px; overflow: hidden; line-height: 0;" class="mce_SELRES_start">﻿</span> Stay safe, and together we can flatten the curve.
