University students around the country are currently barred from attending at their premises and are required to study from home where possible. Under level 4 of the lockdown, the controlled return of final year students in programmes requiring clinical training was allowed. This started with medicine (MBChB) and will be followed in a phased approach of other programmes, such as nursing, dental, and veterinary sciences. Nzimande said his department has been “working hard during this month of May towards saving the academic year whilst saving lives”. He said all public universities have developed strategies for remote multi-modal teaching and learning during the period of the current lockdown to be implemented from 1 June. “Each institution has committed to ensuring that all students are given a fair opportunity to complete the academic year 2020,” he said.
