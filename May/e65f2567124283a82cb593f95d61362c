Cloud backup provider Backblaze has released its hard drive reliability statistics for the first quarter of 2020. The company compared active hard drives used in its operations from Seagate, Toshiba, and HGST to compile the report. Reliability was measured as an annualised failure rate, calculated using the number of drive failures relative to the number of active drive days for each disk. Backblaze recorded the number of failures for each hard drive from 1 January to 31 March 2020, extrapolating the annualised failure rate from this data. The company tested a total of 129,764 hard drives this quarter, equating to a total of 11,376,467 days worth of hard drive operation across all products. Backblaze noted that in Q1 2020, its current hard drive configuration delivered the lowest annualised failure rate it has recorded for any quarter since it began taking down reliability statistics in 2013. “During this quarter four drive models, from three manufacturers, had zero drive failures,” Backblaze said. “None of the Toshiba 4TB and Seagate 16TB drives failed in Q1, but both drives had less than 10,000 drive days during the quarter.” Additionally, Backblaze previously predicted that by the end of 2019 it would have fewer than 15,000 4TB drives – but the cloud provider said it has been too busy installing new drives to migrate from smaller hard drives. The company also predicted that it would surpass one exabyte of storage, which it achieved in March 2020. The most reliable hard drives for Q1 2020 are listed below, along with their annualised failure rates calculated from their performance during the quarter. The table below shows the reliability of hard drive models Backblaze had in service as of 31 March 2020. The reporting period is from April 2013 through 31 December 2019.
