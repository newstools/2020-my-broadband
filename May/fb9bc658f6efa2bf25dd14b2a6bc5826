Sony Corp. is planning a digital event to showcase games for its next-generation PlayStation 5 console that may take place as early as next week, according to people with direct knowledge of the matter. The virtual event could be held June 3, though some people also cautioned that plans have been in flux and that the date may change. Other PlayStation 5 events may follow in the coming weeks and months, and Sony is not expected to reveal every essential detail on the console during its first presentation. A Sony spokesperson declined to comment. The company’s shares were largely unchanged in early Thursday trading in Tokyo. The Japanese tech giant has only let out a trickle of information on the PlayStation 5 so far, which the company says remains on track for release this holiday season despite the Covid-19 pandemic. Chief Executive Officer Kenichiro Yoshida said earlier this month that Sony “will soon be announcing a strong lineup of PS5 games.” June is traditionally highlighted by the biggest games industry conference, E3 in Los Angeles, but that was canceled this year due to the spread of the virus. In response, Sony and many game publishers are refashioning their promotional plans around streamed online presentations. While only a small circle within Sony are privy to the appearance of the PS5 console, the controller has been shared with outside developers and, fearing it wouldn’t be able to control leaks, the company made it public in early April. Fans have been eager to hear about the lineup of video games that will launch alongside the console and later. Microsoft Corp., Sony’s most direct rival in the console wars, has put out regular streams and updates about the upcoming Xbox Series X, which is also planned for release this fall. <img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-353741" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/PlayStation-4-sales-jumps-640x396.jpg" alt="PlayStation 4 sales jumps" width="640" height="396" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/PlayStation-4-sales-jumps-640x396.jpg 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/PlayStation-4-sales-jumps-600x371.jpg 600w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/PlayStation-4-sales-jumps-768x476.jpg 768w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/PlayStation-4-sales-jumps.jpg 814w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" />
