South Africa will move to alert level 3 of the national lockdown on 1 June, which will see the easing of many level 4 restrictions. Opening up the economy, lifting the curfew, easing restrictions on exercise, and allowing the sale of alcohol were widely welcomed. While level 3 will only kick in next week, there are already questions as to when the government expects to lower the national lockdown to alert level 2. Minister of Cooperative Governance and Traditional Affairs Nkosazana Dlamini Zuma said it is too early to comment on lowering the alert level. She said deciding on changing the lockdown alert level will depend on the spread of the virus during level 3. Dlamini Zuma added that it is possible that, under the new differentiated risk strategy, some areas will enter alert level 2 before others. President Cyril Ramaphosa announced the differentiated approach to deal with areas that have far higher levels of infection and transmission, called coronavirus hotspots, on Sunday. A hotspot is defined as an area that has more than 5 infected people per every 100,000 people or where new infections are increasing at a fast pace. Current coronavirus hotspots include Tshwane, Johannesburg, Ekurhuleni, Ethekwini, Nelson Mandela Bay, Buffalo City, and Cape Town. The other areas that are hotspots include the West Coast, Overberg and Cape Winelands, Chris Hani district in the Eastern Cape, and iLembe district in KwaZulu-Natal. “We are particularly concerned about the situation in the city of Cape Town and in the Western Cape generally, which now has more than half the total infections in the country,” said Ramaphosa. The list of hotspot areas will be reviewed every two weeks depending on the progression of the virus. Ramaphosa previously gave basic guidelines about the five alert levels: The image below provides an overview of the 5 levels. <img class="aligncenter wp-image-349303 size-large" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Levels-1-640x321.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="321" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Levels-1-640x321.jpg 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Levels-1-600x301.jpg 600w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Levels-1-768x385.jpg 768w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Levels-1.jpg 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> The latest regulations state the minister for cooperative governance and traditional affairs must, upon recommendation of the health minister, determine the alert level at national, provincial, metropolitan, and district level. The national alert level will automatically apply to all provinces, metropolitan areas and districts unless a different alert level is determined for these areas. Under the new system, the movement of persons in and out of a coronavirus hotspot may be restricted. To determine whether an area is a coronavirus hotspot by considering: The minister of health must oversee the implementation of a plan, developed in consultation with the provincial MEC for health, to contain the spread of infection in a hotspot.
