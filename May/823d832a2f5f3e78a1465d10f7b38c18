It stated that it is experiencing issues in maintaining the number of daily COVID-19 tests due to a shortage of materials. “As a country, we are now facing a challenge with the global shortage of testing reagents,” the department said. “We understand it is becoming a challenge to many other countries.” “We are, however, continuing our efforts to secure these reagents from other suppliers all over the world,” the department added.
