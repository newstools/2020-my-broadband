The COVID-19 outbreak and subsequent lockdown in South Africa has dramatically changed the media landscape. Many online publications have seen a dramatic increase in readership during the lockdown as people look for the latest coronavirus news. Print publications, in comparison, have suffered. Caxton has ceased certain printing operations in Gauteng while other media houses have implemented salary cuts or even closed down. Associated Media Publishing, which published Cosmopolitan, House & Leisure, Good Housekeeping, and Women on Wheels, shut its doors on 1 May. Arena Holdings, which publishes the Sunday Times, Business Day, and The Sowetan, has asked its staff to take a 30% pay cut for three months. This was necessary because of the impact of the coronavirus pandemic on advertising revenue. They were not alone – Independent Media and Mail & Guardian are also implementing salary cuts and other measures to ensure financial sustainability. While print publishers are suffering, online publishers have seen a big increase in readership during the lockdown. The April 2020 Narratiive statistics showed News24 attracted 11 million unique browsers last month – a year-on-year increase of 62%. TimesLive is the second-largest news website with 8.2 million unique South African browsers, followed by IOL on 8.1 million. The table below shows the top 20 websites in South Africa, based on South African unique browsers. It also shows the year-on-year change in readership.
