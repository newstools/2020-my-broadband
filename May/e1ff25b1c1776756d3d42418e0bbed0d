Instead, it is only School Management Teams (SMTs) and staff who will be expected to report to school premises from 1 June. “The date on which Grade 7 and 12 learners have to report back to school, is 8 June 2020.” It said this delay is due to findings presented to the CEM (Council of Education Ministers) yesterday by three entities which showed that schools are not yet ready to reopen to students. However, Western Cape Education Department MEC Debbie Schafer has said that particular schools in the province will still be opening to receive learners on Monday. “Whilst we are aware of the many anxieties surrounding Covid-19, keeping schools closed indefinitely is not going to resolve them,” Schafer said. “We shall accordingly be open for learners tomorrow. The week will be used primarily for the orientation of learners into the new Covid-19 safety and learning environment.”
