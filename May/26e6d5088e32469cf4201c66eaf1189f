The table below shows the number of recorded cases and deaths in each province across South Africa. The Department of Health previously experienced a steep decline in daily tests, stating that it was experiencing issues in maintaining the number of daily COVID-19 tests due to a shortage of materials. “As a country, we are now facing a challenge with the global shortage of testing reagents,” the department said. “We understand it is becoming a challenge to many other countries.” “We are, however, continuing our efforts to secure these reagents from other suppliers all over the world,” the department added. The Department seems to have now resolved this shortage, with the number of tests increasing to just under 30,000 over the past day. As of today, the cumulative number of confirmed COVID-19 cases in South Africa is 25 937. 654 996 tests have been done to date with 29 005 tests done in 24hrs. 28 more COVID-19 related deaths- this brings the total national deaths to 552.
