Last night President Cyril Ramaphosa provided feedback on South Africa’s response to the coronavirus pandemic and gave some details on the way forward. Ramaphosa said despite its duration and its severity, the lockdown was necessary to delay the spread of the virus and prevent a huge surge in infections. He said without the lockdown and related measures at least 80,000 South Africans could have been infected by now and the death toll could have been 8 times higher. “We should never forget that the purpose of the lockdown was to delay the spread of the virus and prevent a huge surge of infections,” he said. “By delaying the spread of the disease, we have been able to strengthen the capacity of our health system and to put in place wide-ranging public health programmes to better manage the inevitable increase in infections.” The country now has nearly 25,000 additional beds available for quarantine and the government was able to source and produce large quantities of personal protective equipment for health workers, vital medical equipment and other supplies. Ramaphosa said for now, infections are mostly concentrated in a few metropolitan municipalities and districts in the country. This means that most of the country can be moved to a lower alert level which will allow for more relaxed regulations. Here is what Ramaphosa said about the plans to move to alert level 3 and changes to the current level 4 regulations which were recently published. A consultation process has begun to move to level 3 by the end of May. However, parts of the country with the highest rates of infection remain on level 4. Ramaphosa did not give details on which parts of the country will remain on level 4, but the government did release a map to show the prevalence of COVID-19 in different areas. <img class="aligncenter wp-image-351951 size-medium" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/COVID-19-prevalence-600x301.jpg" alt="COVID-19 prevalence" width="600" height="301" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/COVID-19-prevalence-600x301.jpg 600w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/COVID-19-prevalence-640x321.jpg 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/COVID-19-prevalence-768x385.jpg 768w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/COVID-19-prevalence.jpg 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> Ramaphosa said in the coming days changes to level 4 regulations will be announced.
