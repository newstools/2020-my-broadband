South Africa will move from alert level 4 to alert level 3 of the national lockdown on 1 June, which will ease many of the restrictions which are currently in place. President Cyril Ramaphosa announced that wholesale and retail trade will be fully opened, including stores, spaza shops, and informal traders. Alcohol will also be allowed to be sold at certain times. The current 20:00 – 05:00 curfew will be lifted, and people will be allowed to exercise outside during extended hours. Accommodation and domestic air travel will be allowed for business under alert level 3, which will be phased in on dates to be announced. Rules for restaurants will also change, and they will now be allowed to offer delivery, collection, and drive-through services. One of the biggest surprises is that places of worship – including churches, synagogues, temples, and mosques – will be allowed to open under strict conditions. This includes a limit of 50 people, social distancing will have to be observed, and all worshippers and participants will have to wear face masks. Minister of Cooperative Governance and Traditional Affairs Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma and Minister of Trade, Industry and Competition Ebrahim Patel have now provided further details on the level 3 regulations. Dlamini-Zuma said South Africa has managed to flatten the COVID-19 infection curve. However, the number of confirmed COVID-19 cases are still rising and the peak is still on the horizon. She said the lockdown will continue until the country has flattened the infection curve for a sustained period of time. She warned that the risk of a rapid increase in COVID-19 infections is now greater than the start of the coronavirus outbreak, however. Dlamini-Zuma reiterated that every person who enters a workplace or public facility must also wear a face mask. The table below provides an overview of the new level 3 lockdown rules which will kick in on 1 June.
