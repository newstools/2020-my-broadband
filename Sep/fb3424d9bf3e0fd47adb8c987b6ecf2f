MyBroadband has seen a spike in advertising campaigns since the lockdown started as companies look for value-for-money and a high return on investment (ROI). With people spending more time online for both work and leisure, these digital campaigns have shown excellent results. All campaigns, however, are not equal – which raises the question as to which online marketing campaigns are producing the best results. The answer depends on what a company is looking for. Some campaigns provided companies with exceptional brand awareness, while others produced a high number of leads. There are four different campaign types which have performed particularly well over the past few months. Here they are. The best-performing “single-component” campaigns on MyBroadband are sponsored articles which are amplified through social media promotions. With these campaigns, companies can create a highly-targeted message and ensure it reaches the right audience. This combination is very effective and produces exceptional engagement and a high return on investment. <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-369239" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Sponsored-Content.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="430" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Sponsored-Content.jpg 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Sponsored-Content-595x400.jpg 595w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Sponsored-Content-300x202.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> Larger companies who want to ensure the best possible exposure are launching blended campaigns which include banner ads, sponsored articles, and social media campaigns. The performance of these campaigns in terms of both brand awareness and engagement is unmatched. The repeat rate on these campaigns is very high, which shows the effectiveness of this strategy. <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-369235" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Banners-1.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="430" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Banners-1.jpg 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Banners-1-595x400.jpg 595w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Banners-1-300x202.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> MyBroadband’s new online talk show, What’s Next with Aki Anastasiou, is a big success – with over half-a-million views in the first two months.

The new online format was a hit with delegates, as it offered them the freedom to watch the discussions, engage with sponsors, and network with others when it suited them. Companies also received an overwhelming response from delegates who wanted to connect with them and find out more about their offerings. <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-364082" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Cloud2020-Huawei.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="430" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Cloud2020-Huawei.jpg 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Cloud2020-Huawei-595x400.jpg 595w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Cloud2020-Huawei-300x202.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> For more information, contact MyBroadband This article was published in partnership with MyBroadband.
