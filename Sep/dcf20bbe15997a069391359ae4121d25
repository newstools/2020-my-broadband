Data prices are a major barrier preventing many South Africans from enjoying a variety of great video content. This has been remedied to a degree this year, after mobile networks were obliged to work with the Competition Commission to reduce their data prices. This followed the publication of the final report of the Data Services Market Inquiry in December 2019. The Commission created this inquiry to investigate the elements of the telecommunications market that had led to “high prices for data services”. Despite these reductions in data prices, there are some use cases where data prices are simply too expensive for many South Africans. An example of this is that many South Africans cannot afford the high data costs that are required to stream video content on platforms like YouTube, Netflix, and Showmax. To help these customers, mobile networks offer bundles that make video streaming more affordable for South Africans. Vodacom and Telkom both offer dedicated video streaming bundles, while a number of MTN and Cell C platform-limited data bundles support video streaming services. These deals and bundles are detailed below. <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-348665" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Smartphone_Vodacom.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="430" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Smartphone_Vodacom.jpg 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Smartphone_Vodacom-595x400.jpg 595w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Smartphone_Vodacom-300x202.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-152615" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/MTN-logo-yellow.jpg" alt="MTN logo yellow" width="640" height="430" /> <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-262635" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Cell-C-logo-on-iPhone.jpg" alt="Cell C logo on iPhone" width="640" height="430" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Cell-C-logo-on-iPhone.jpg 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Cell-C-logo-on-iPhone-300x202.jpg 300w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Cell-C-logo-on-iPhone-595x400.jpg 595w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-329771" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Telkom-logo.jpg" alt="Telkom logo" width="640" height="430" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Telkom-logo.jpg 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Telkom-logo-595x400.jpg 595w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Telkom-logo-300x202.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" />
