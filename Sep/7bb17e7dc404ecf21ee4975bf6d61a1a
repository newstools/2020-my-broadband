Transport Minister Fikile Mbalula said opening international travel is top of their agenda, but it will be done following global benchmarks. Mbalula made these comments during an inspection of the O.R Tambo International Airport to assess adherence to COVID-19 regulations and directions. This inspection follows complaints received by the Minister on lack of compliance to aviation regulations related to airlines. At a press briefing following the inspection, Mbalula said they will consider the risk which different countries pose when opening international travel. They are also considering the measures which must be taken when international travellers start to visit South Africa. While international travel poses risks for South Africa, the transport minister said we should not fall behind global standards. He said many other countries are starting to open international travel, which is guiding the government’s decision making on the matter. “In terms of time frames, this will happen very soon in terms of the movement to other levels,” he said. “Very soon international travel will be opened, and we will announce measures when it happens.” <span data-mce-type="bookmark" style="display: inline-block; width: 0px; overflow: hidden; line-height: 0;" class="mce_SELRES_start">﻿</span>
