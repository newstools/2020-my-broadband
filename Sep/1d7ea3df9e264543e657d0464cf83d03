The next-generation of gaming consoles, the Sony PlayStation 5 and Microsoft Xbox Series X, are around the corner. Microsoft has confirmed the Series X will be launched on 10 November 2020, with a recommended retail price of R11,999 in South Africa. The PlayStation 5 also carries a price tag of R11,999 for the standard console with a disc drive, and R9,999 for the Digital Edition. Both companies have punted one key capability as a major selling point for their consoles – 4K gaming at 60 frames per second. Technically speaking, 4K is filming standard with a resolution of 4,096 x 2,160. However, when it comes to display standards, the Ultra High Definition resolution of 3,840 x 2,160 is accepted as 4K. Those who don’t yet own a UHD/4K TV or monitor will have to acquire one to fully enjoy the graphics power of the Series X and PS5. To help you minimise the total price of your next-generation gaming investment, we’ve compiled a list of the most affordable 4K TVs and computer monitors available in South Africa. It should be noted that our only criterion for this list was that the display offered a 3,840 x 2,160 resolution. We did not consider any additional display features which will likely improve the overall viewing experience – such as HDR, local dimming, or panel types. If you would prefer to use your console in the living room or while sitting on a couch at a distance from the display, then a TV is the optimal solution. The cheapest UHD display we spotted online was a 49-inch Sansui UHD TV at R4,299 from HiFi Corporation. This TV does not offer built-in smart capability or HDR, however, and other features were also limited. Below are the top 10 cheapest 4K TVs we were able to find. <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-367344" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Sannsui-49-inch-UHD-LED-TV.jpg" alt="Sansui 49-inch UHD LED TV" width="640" height="430" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Sannsui-49-inch-UHD-LED-TV.jpg 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Sannsui-49-inch-UHD-LED-TV-595x400.jpg 595w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Sannsui-49-inch-UHD-LED-TV-300x202.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-367388" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Sansui-50-inch-UHD-Smart-TV.jpg" alt="Sansui 50-inch UHD Smart TV" width="640" height="430" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Sansui-50-inch-UHD-Smart-TV.jpg 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Sansui-50-inch-UHD-Smart-TV-595x400.jpg 595w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Sansui-50-inch-UHD-Smart-TV-300x202.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-367354" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Sinotec-50-inch-UHD-Smart-TV.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="430" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Sinotec-50-inch-UHD-Smart-TV.jpg 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Sinotec-50-inch-UHD-Smart-TV-595x400.jpg 595w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Sinotec-50-inch-UHD-Smart-TV-300x202.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-367334" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Hisense-43-inch-UHD-Smart-TV.jpg" alt="Hisense 43-inch UHD Smart TV" width="640" height="430" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Hisense-43-inch-UHD-Smart-TV.jpg 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Hisense-43-inch-UHD-Smart-TV-595x400.jpg 595w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Hisense-43-inch-UHD-Smart-TV-300x202.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-367348" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Samsung-43-inch-UHD-Crystal-TV.jpg" alt="Samsung 43-inch UHD Crystal TV" width="640" height="430" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Samsung-43-inch-UHD-Crystal-TV.jpg 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Samsung-43-inch-UHD-Crystal-TV-595x400.jpg 595w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Samsung-43-inch-UHD-Crystal-TV-300x202.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-367350" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/JVC-49-inch-UHD-TV.jpg" alt="JVC 49-inch UHD TV" width="640" height="430" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/JVC-49-inch-UHD-TV.jpg 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/JVC-49-inch-UHD-TV-595x400.jpg 595w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/JVC-49-inch-UHD-TV-300x202.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> If you are more concerned with features like low input lag, high refresh rates, and tight pixel density, then you could opt for a UHD monitor. One stumbling block in this category, however, is the prevalence of ultra-wide panels with unconventional aspect ratios. An example of this is Samsung’s C43J89 UltraWide Gaming Monitor, with a resolution of 3,840 x 1,200. At this time, it is not yet known whether the PS5 or Xbox Series X will support aspect ratios other than 16:9, which correlates with the ratio of horizontal and vertical pixels in HD and UHD resolution. We excluded any gaming monitors with irregular aspect ratios from our comparison. <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-367330" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/LG-27-inch-UHD-IPS-Monitor-UL500-W.jpg" alt="LG 27-inch UHD IPS Monitor - UL500-W" width="640" height="430" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/LG-27-inch-UHD-IPS-Monitor-UL500-W.jpg 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/LG-27-inch-UHD-IPS-Monitor-UL500-W-595x400.jpg 595w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/LG-27-inch-UHD-IPS-Monitor-UL500-W-300x202.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-367318" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Samsung-28-inch-UHD-Monitor.jpg" alt="Samsung 28-inch UHD Monitor" width="640" height="430" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Samsung-28-inch-UHD-Monitor.jpg 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Samsung-28-inch-UHD-Monitor-595x400.jpg 595w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Samsung-28-inch-UHD-Monitor-300x202.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" />  <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-367390" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/ASUS-28-inch-UHD-IPS-Gaming-Monitor.jpg" alt="ASUS 28-inch UHD IPS Gaming Monitor" width="640" height="430" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/ASUS-28-inch-UHD-IPS-Gaming-Monitor.jpg 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/ASUS-28-inch-UHD-IPS-Gaming-Monitor-595x400.jpg 595w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/ASUS-28-inch-UHD-IPS-Gaming-Monitor-300x202.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-367316" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Dell-24-inch-UHD-Monitor.jpg" alt="Dell 24-inch UHD Monitor" width="640" height="430" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Dell-24-inch-UHD-Monitor.jpg 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Dell-24-inch-UHD-Monitor-595x400.jpg 595w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Dell-24-inch-UHD-Monitor-300x202.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-367358" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Samsung-32-inch-UHD-Space-Monitor.jpg" alt="Samsung 32-inch UHD Space Monitor" width="640" height="430" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Samsung-32-inch-UHD-Space-Monitor.jpg 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Samsung-32-inch-UHD-Space-Monitor-595x400.jpg 595w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Samsung-32-inch-UHD-Space-Monitor-300x202.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-367384" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Samsung-31.5-inch-UHD-QLED-Monitor.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="430" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Samsung-31.5-inch-UHD-QLED-Monitor.jpg 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Samsung-31.5-inch-UHD-QLED-Monitor-595x400.jpg 595w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Samsung-31.5-inch-UHD-QLED-Monitor-300x202.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-367332" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/LG-27-inch-UHD-IPS-Monitor.jpg" alt="LG 27-inch UHD IPS Monitor" width="640" height="430" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/LG-27-inch-UHD-IPS-Monitor.jpg 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/LG-27-inch-UHD-IPS-Monitor-595x400.jpg 595w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/LG-27-inch-UHD-IPS-Monitor-300x202.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" />
