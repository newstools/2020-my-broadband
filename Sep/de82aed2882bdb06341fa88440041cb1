If you are still on ADSL, VDSL, or a slow and unstable connection, it is time to move to fibre or fixed-LTE. DSL and copper-based services in areas covered by fibre networks will be plans to be terminated by December 2020. What this means is that ADSL subscribers in areas where there is fibre will have to migrate by 1 December. Many people may question this decision, but it should be seen as a positive development aimed at helping internet users. Fibre offers higher speeds and lower latency than ADSL, it is more stable and reliable, and it is not susceptible to copper theft. The biggest benefit, however, is price. An uncapped fibre service is cheaper than a comparable ADSL or VDSL connection, which means moving to fibre makes perfect sense.
