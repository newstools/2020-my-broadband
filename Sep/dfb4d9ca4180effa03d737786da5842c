Several Capitec clients awoke on Friday to find that money had been deducted from their accounts in the early hours of the morning. On social media, clients posted that they received SMS notifications for purchases and cash withdrawals at Shoprite stores. “#Capitec bathong my last money,” one person posted, along with a screenshot showing a deduction of R438.63 for purchases at a Shoprite in Krugersdorp and an available balance of zero. Other Capitec clients on Twitter also posted screenshots showing a similar issue with cash withdrawals being made at Shoprite stores. Capitec told EWN that the retailer uses a different bank for its card machines. “We are aware of a technical issue between us and another bank that has caused Capitec clients who transacted on this bank’s card machines to be double deducted,” Capitec said in a post on Twitter and in an SMS to clients. “Our IT team is working to rectify the issue. The transactions will be reversed within the next 24 hours.” The bank subsequently published the following statement explaining the error: The double deduction was caused by a technical issue on Nedbank’s systems, which affected billing on their point of sale terminals. We take this very seriously and are working with them to rectify the error as quickly as possible. We have to follow a standard industry process, which can unfortunately take up to 24 hours. We apologise to our clients for the inconvenience. https://twitter.com/A_WholeBrownie/status/1304298189420408832 https://twitter.com/Radebe_merci/status/1304291576374587392
