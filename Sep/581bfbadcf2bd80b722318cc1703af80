Businesses need to utilise the digital tools available to them if they wish to grow and increase their productivity. However, many businesses struggle to keep track of all their software and hardware, or determine which of it is not working optimally. This is often because they use many different technology solutions from multiple providers that are difficult to keep track of. Fortunately, this is easily solved with a powerful IT management solution that allows you to control your company’s IT systems through a single interface. SolarWinds, which is distributed by ATS Network Management throughout Africa, offers a comprehensive range of over 60 IT management products that will improve your business efficiency. One of SolarWinds’ biggest strengths is its modular nature – you can start with just a few software products and add more products as you need them. SolarWinds is also technology-agnostic, which means that you don’t have to worry about any compatibility issues. It is therefore unsurprising that SolarWinds has been recognised as a market leader in its field. This includes having nine of its products named by TrustRadius as “top-rated” in their respective categories – including SolarWinds Server and Application Monitor, and SolarWinds Service Desk. Additionally, SolarWinds’ Application Performance Monitoring (APM) suite was named as a leader in the 2020 Gartner Magic Quadrant for APM. All of this proves that SolarWinds is clearly the right choice for your business. One of the most popular SolarWinds products is its IT Operations Management (ITOM) software. Unlike many competing ITOM products, which only let you know if your systems and technologies are running or not, the SolarWinds IT Operations Manager offers detailed analytics and predictive intelligence to optimise your system performance and help you solve any problems that may arise. This comprehensive software solution also offers cross IT stack management, which enables you to compare performance metrics from multiple sources. Another major benefit of ITOM from SolarWinds is that it can be used to monitor your on-premise environment as well as your cloud workloads at the same time and through the same interface. Another popular solution available from SolarWinds is its APM software, SolarWinds Server and Application Monitor (SAM). Applications are one of the most critical elements of your IT systems, and it is therefore crucial that you can determine when these applications are not performing optimally. SAM will help you detect issues with your applications quickly and also assists with the more general optimisation of your systems – including improving the performance of your databases and the applications that rely on them.
