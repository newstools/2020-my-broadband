Qualcomm has announced the Snapdragon 732G SoC – a new mobile chip that offers improved performance for mid-range smartphones. The chip pairs upgraded versions of the eight-core Kryo 470 CPU and Adreno 618 GPU, which were first introduced in the 732G’s predecessor – 2019’s Snapdragon 730G. The company punted gaming capabilities as one of the big areas of improvement with the latest chip. Overall, Qualcomm claims the upgraded Adreno 618 GPU is up to 15% faster to allow for sharper graphics rendering compared to the previous generation. It comes with select Snapdragon Elite Gaming features which enhance graphics and motion to deliver better colours and smoother gameplay. These include True HDR Gaming, which displays colours in more than a billion shades, as well as Qualcomm Game Jank Reducer and Physically Based Rendering (PBR) to “add fluidity and realism” in games. On the processing side, the Kryo 470 boasts two of ARM’s Cortex-A76 cores and six Cortex-A55 cores. The “prime” Cortex-A76 core clock has been bumped up slightly to run at up to 2.3GHz, while a “performance” Cortex-A76 clock goes up to 2.2GHz. The remaining six “efficient” Cortex-A55 cores are clocked at up to 1.8GHz. With regards to other components and features, the Snapdragon 732G keeps much of the same as its predecessor. This includes the Qualcomm Hexagon Vector Accelerator and Hexagon Tensor Accelerator, which handles the chip’s AI capability. For smartphone photography, it can carry up to a 192MP camera sensor and supports shooting of 4K HDR video at 30fps, with slow-motion recording at 240fps in 720p. On the connectivity side, it features the X15 Cat.13 LTE modem, which makes it capable of speeds of up to 800Mbps. Xiaomi affiliate Poco will be the first manufacturer to feature the Snapdragon 732G in one of its upcoming smartphones. No details have been revealed about when this smartphone will be available, however.
