Flagship smartphones offer fantastic features but they also have expensive price tags, often requiring buyers to fork out about R30,000. While these smartphones offer impressive performance and features for those who can afford them, this is simply not a realistic price to pay for a smartphone for many South Africans. However, some users still want a smartphone that has a premium look and feel, and that offers impressive performance. These users could spend up to R10,000 for a smartphone that offers high-quality performance and build quality. While these handsets might not be as powerful as their R30,000 counterparts, they offer superior value for money. If you have a budget of R10,000 for a new smartphone, there are many great options for you to choose from. We have picked some of the best smartphones currently available in South Africa that cost under R10,000. The prices for these smartphones are sourced from Takealot.
