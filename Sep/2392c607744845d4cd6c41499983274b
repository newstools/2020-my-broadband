Lenovo has unveiled the Legion Slim 7i, which it claims is the lightest gaming laptop to ever offer RTX graphics. The laptop weighs under 1.8kg and is just 18mm thin, Lenovo said. Director of Global Product Marketing Karan Kapur said that this was a tough gaming laptop to create, as usually, gaming laptops need to trade-off either performance or design. “Traditionally, gaming PCs that are well designed have lacked performance and thermals, and when they’re powerful, they’re loud, big and heavy,” said Kapur. He explained that despite this, Lenovo’s goal was to create a laptop that was below 1.8kg in weight and offered RTX graphics – which it has achieved with the Legion Slim 7i. The Legion Slim 7i boasts up to Nvidia GeForce RTX 2060 graphics using a Max-Q design. Users can also choose up to an Intel i9-10980 processor, and the Legion Slim 7i supports up to 2TB M.2 NVMe storage. It also supports up to 32GB RAM with a 71WHr battery. There are three display options available to customers – a Full HD 60Hz display, a Full HD 144Hz monitor, and a 4K 60Hz display. Despite its slim form factor, Lenovo highlighted that the Legion Slim 7i has a full-sized TrueStrike keyboard. These keys offer sub-1ms response time. One of the most important elements of the Legion Slim 7i gaming laptop is its cooling system. This system offers 31% improved air intake thanks to machine-drilled holes that are positioned over the laptop’s CPU and GPU. Photos and specifications of the Legion Slim 7i are below. <img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-365764" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Lenovo-Legion7i-640x430.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="430" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Lenovo-Legion7i.jpg 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Lenovo-Legion7i-595x400.jpg 595w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Lenovo-Legion7i-300x202.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> <img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-365762" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Lenovo-Legion-7i-2-640x430.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="430" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Lenovo-Legion-7i-2.jpg 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Lenovo-Legion-7i-2-595x400.jpg 595w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Lenovo-Legion-7i-2-300x202.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" />
