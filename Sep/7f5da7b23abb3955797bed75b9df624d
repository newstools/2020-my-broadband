National Treasury has revealed that the SABC, Airports Company of South Africa Limited (ACSA), and the SA Post Office have asked it for billions in financial aid. National Treasury briefed Parliament on Tuesday, saying Denel faces a risk of being placed under business rescue or liquidation. Denel has posted a R1.7-billion loss for the 2019/20 financial year, which was attributed to a significant decline in revenue. EWN reported that Denel is struggling to pay salaries and is forecast to have a “negative equity position of R3.3 billion as of March this year”. During its session in Parliament National Treasury also reportedly revealed that: This financial support follows SABC and SA Post Office bailouts amounting to billions over the last few years. Taxpayers are already under pressure because of the weak economy and increased government spending, but things are set to get even tougher. Eskom is planning to significantly increase electricity prices despite the loss of jobs and widespread salary cuts in the country. Eskom spokesperson Sikonathi Mantshantsha admitted that load-shedding is one of the factors which led to job cuts in South Africa. However, he said, they need to invest in infrastructure to turn the company around and avoid load-shedding in future. He said the reality is that this investment must be paid for, which is why electricity price increases are necessary. MyBroadband asked Eskom how it is possible to measure whether the power utility is wasting money or improving the utility, but it did not provide an answer. In February, National Treasury revealed that it has allocated R162 billion to financially distressed state-owned companies. Of the total allocations, Eskom accounts for 82%. In 2019/20, the government allocated R49 billion to Eskom and committed R112 billion in medium-term funding. If one looks at what is planned until 2023, the allocation jumps to R291.2 billion. The table below provides a summary of historic recapitalisations and bailouts of state-owned companies since 2008. <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-365752" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Bailouts.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="400" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Bailouts.jpg 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Bailouts-600x375.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" />
