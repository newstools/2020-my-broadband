MultiChoice and SuperSport’s big changes to their DStv offering, including channels being cut and others being added, kicks in today. One of the biggest changes is the reorganised M-Net Movie channel list, which has been cut down from six channels to four channels. MultiChoice highlighted that the reduction in M-Net Movie channels does not impact the number of movies subscribers have access to. The holiday pop-up channel fliekNET also becomes a permanent fixture on the DStv platform today. This change supports the recently announced Add Movies product, which allows some DStv subscribers to access M-Net’s top three movie channels for a fee. DStv Compact Plus, Compact, Family, Access, EasyView, and Indian packages can access M-Net Movies 1, M-Net Movies 2, and fliekNET for an additional R99 per month. DStv Premium subscribers have access to all DStv content, including all four M-Net Movie channels described below. Today Multichoice also cut the BBC First channel on DStv, which it said is part of a “refresh of its British entertainment lineup”, with a selection of the British drama continuing on BBC Brit. The biggest changes which kicked in today are related to the SuperSport offering on DStv. DStv customers have already received two 24-hour ESPN channels on 29 July after MultiChoice signed a deal with The Walt Disney Company Africa. Sports leagues which are available on ESPN and ESPN2 include the National Basketball Association (NBA), National Football League (NFL), and Major League Baseball (MLB). The channels also offer live football from the English Football League (EFL), Scottish Premier Football League (SPFL), Dutch Eredivisie, and Major League Soccer (MLS). SuperSport has now overhauled its sports channels on DStv, launching a new line-up of channels across bouquets. It dropped the numbering system it has used for its channels for the past two decades, replacing it with a thematic offering around individual sports. There are now dedicated channels for leagues and sports, among them the PSL, the Premier League, La Liga, rugby, cricket, golf, tennis, and motorsport. The new channels will go beyond live sport and also offer supplementary programming such as magazine shows and highlights. SuperSport’s flagship channel – Grandstand – will host the best of any live curated sport available to Premium customers, including soccer, rugby, cricket, golf, and tennis. SuperSport CEO Gideon Khobane said the changes will see additional SuperSport channels of local and international sporting content added to the DStv package. <img class="aligncenter wp-image-362402 size-large" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/New-SuperSport-Channel-line-up-640x367.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="367" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/New-SuperSport-Channel-line-up-640x367.jpg 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/New-SuperSport-Channel-line-up-600x345.jpg 600w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/New-SuperSport-Channel-line-up-768x441.jpg 768w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/New-SuperSport-Channel-line-up.jpg 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> The table below provides an overview of all the big DStv changes which kick in today.
