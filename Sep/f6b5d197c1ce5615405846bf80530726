There have been many challenges this year, especially in the areas of business and economic activity. Never before have we seen such a massive impact on how we do business, caused by all the ripple effects due to the global pandemic. Of all the sectors and industries that have withstood these changes, the information and communications technology sector have probably experienced the most significant seismic shifts. Being clear about the challenges ahead and how to face them head-on, will be the difference between being capsized by change or thriving through the times. <img class="size-large wp-image-324433 aligncenter" src="https://test.mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/IP_My-BB-4-Infographic-640x430.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="430" /> Whether its the protection of business data, or putting mechanisms in place to protect the privacy of clients and users, security management has become one of the core focuses and challenges of the modern era. Making sure safety and security is the topmost priority has become one of the core functions of any information and communications technology entity. CIOs and IT leaders will face a growing challenge in their digital transformation journeys: Merging legacy technologies with modern technologies. The fact is, many businesses still rely on legacy systems. Not all of these systems can be easily replaced. The challenge facing CIOs and IT leaders: How can you merge legacy and modern systems, without sacrificing function or security? Whether it’s due to lockdown or load-shedding, many businesses have been experiencing lapses in their fixed-line connections. Being unexpectedly offline in a time when ongoing sales and transactions might mean the difference between staying open and indefinitely closing shop, has become an all too real scenario for many business owners. As trends and technology shift on a daily and sometimes hourly basis, it is hardly possible to stay updated with all the latest skills and competencies needed to address all the emerging needs of the modern business.
