On 18 August, South Africa moved to level 2 of the nationwide lockdown, which permits restaurants to operate under eased regulations. As coronavirus cases are still being confirmed daily, however, wearing a cloth mask in public places is mandatory and practising social distancing is strongly encouraged. This means that although people can visit a restaurant to enjoy a meal, staying at home and ordering in is the better alternative – and who better to order in from than a South African favourite like Pizza Perfect. Pizza Perfect has been back to normal trading hours since lockdown level 3 offering their very own delivery service, and as always the franchise is committed to providing South Africans with perfect pizzas which are made in kitchens that are in adherence to the standards of South Africa’s hygiene and health protocols. Started 27 August, Pizza Perfect is running their “Lockdown loaded deal”, which means that when you buy 2 large Classic pizzas, any 4 new desserts, and a 2L cooldrink* for only R289, you will get a free 50ml bottle of hand sanitiser and a 3-ply collectable mask. <img class="aligncenter wp-image-365972" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/In-article-image-1.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="640" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/In-article-image-1.jpg 800w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/In-article-image-1-400x400.jpg 400w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/In-article-image-1-430x430.jpg 430w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/In-article-image-1-768x768.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> Dessert flavours include jelly and custard, chocolate mousse, and crème caramel.
