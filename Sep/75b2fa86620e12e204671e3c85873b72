Google has launched its new Android 11 operating system, bringing a number of powerful new features to its software platform. The operating system has been in beta for months and has now been released for Google Pixel devices, as well as selected smartphones from OnePlus, Xiaomi, Oppo, and Realme. Highlights of the new platform include dedicated notifications for messaging apps and chat bubbles that are integrated into the user interface. Android 11 also brings built-in screen recording, allowing you to record activity on your smartphone without the use of a third-party app. It also includes integrated smart device functionality. A long press of the power button allows you to quickly control any connected smart devices without the need to open multiple applications. Media controls have been redesigned, and Android Auto now works wirelessly across all Android 11 phones provided you have a compatible vehicle. Google has also improved the privacy and data protection features of Android 11 through the implementation of one-time app permissions, update modules, and expiring hardware or file system permissions. Google said that this update will roll out to more smartphones over the coming months. We have listed the best new features of Android 11 below. <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-366662" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Android-11-2.jpg" alt="Android 11 2" width="640" height="430" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Android-11-2.jpg 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Android-11-2-595x400.jpg 595w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Android-11-2-300x202.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-366668" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Android-11-3.jpg" alt="Android 11 3" width="640" height="430" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Android-11-3.jpg 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Android-11-3-595x400.jpg 595w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Android-11-3-300x202.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-366660" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Android-11-1.jpg" alt="Android 11 1" width="640" height="430" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Android-11-1.jpg 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Android-11-1-595x400.jpg 595w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Android-11-1-300x202.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" />
