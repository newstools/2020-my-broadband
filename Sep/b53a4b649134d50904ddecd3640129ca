Video games have risen in price in recent times due in large part to the long-term decline of the South African rand. This has resulted in prices in excess of R1,000 becoming common for major video game titles. For many gamers, it is difficult to justify spending this much whenever they want to play a new game. Thankfully, there are several subscription services and other options which do not require you to pay such expensive prices. These options are detailed below. Xbox Game Pass is the gaming subscription services offered by Microsoft for its Xbox and PC gamers. It offers access to over 100 popular games, with new games continuing to be added on the same day that they are released for individual purchase. The pricing of these services is as follows: This translates over 12 months to the following (excluding new subscriber special deals): Given that a single AAA game can cost a similar price to a year’s worth of Xbox Game Pass, the service offers incredible value. The extensive range of popular games on Xbox Game Pass includes: <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-308150" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Xbox-Game-Pass-header.jpg" alt="Xbox Game Pass header" width="640" height="430" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Xbox-Game-Pass-header.jpg 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Xbox-Game-Pass-header-300x202.jpg 300w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Xbox-Game-Pass-header-595x400.jpg 595w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> EA Play, formerly known as Origin Access, is another subscription service that offers PC gamers great value.

The most well-known product offered by Humble is its regular bundles. Key to the Humble Bundle’s popularity is that users can pay what they want. “The core of our bundle ‘philosophy’ is flexible pricing,” explains Humble on its website. “When you buy a bundle, you can choose the price you want to pay. You can even choose how your money is divided – between the creators, charity, Humble Partners, and Humble Bundle.” Humble Bundles are usually available in a tiered system, meaning that the more the user pays, the more they will be able to get. Humble Choice is another option from Humble and is a monthly PC game subscription service which gives the user the choice of at least 10 PC games and allows them to choose a number of these games to keep forever. <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-239586" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Humble-Bundle-Logo.jpg" alt="Humble Bundle Logo" width="640" height="430" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Humble-Bundle-Logo.jpg 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Humble-Bundle-Logo-300x202.jpg 300w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Humble-Bundle-Logo-595x400.jpg 595w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> There are a variety of grey market software websites which offer popular game keys for a significantly reduced price. This discount is usually achieved by the sellers purchasing game keys in bulk in regions where prices are lower, and then selling these keys to people for other regions where the prices are higher. It is important to note that these websites are controversial as they exploit international pricing structures, resulting in less revenue for the games’ developers. Many are also less secure, gamers may encounter problems due to the localisation of their grey market key in certain titles.
