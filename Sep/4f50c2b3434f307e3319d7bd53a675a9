Despite some initial scepticism over cryptocurrencies, major investment firms are now coming on board, including Fidelity, JP Morgan, and legendary hedge fund investor Paul Tudor Jones. Revix, backed by JSE-listed Sabvest, offers a straight-forward and sensible way to invest in cryptocurrencies. The online investment platform has brought low-cost diversified crypto-investing to mainstream investors with their ready-made Crypto Bundles, that make crypto investing as easy as buying the JSE Top 40. “Smart investors with a growth mindset have already included crypto assets as a key element in their investment portfolio, and major investment firms are now following suit,” said Revix Founder and CEO Sean Sanders. “Researching, buying, managing, and securing a cryptocurrency portfolio can be complicated, time-consuming and downright intimidating,” explained Sanders. “So, we created an ultra-simple investment platform that enables everyday people to invest in diversified Bundles of the top cryptocurrencies for as little as R500. And what’s great is that you can sell out and withdraw your funds at any time.” Whether you want to invest R500 or R500,000, Revix’s online platform is ideal for people who want to invest in crypto but are unsure how or where to start. After signing up for an account on revix.com, you can then transfer Rands or Bitcoin and within minutes you can invest in any one of the 3 Revix Crypto Bundles on offer: Their Crypto Bundles are unique in that they automatically rebalance once a month, so your investments stay up to date with the latest crypto market movements. Top cryptocurrencies are included in the Bundles while the poor performers are removed. Revix’s Crypto Bundles have outperformed Bitcoin this year, which is already up over 60% year to date. In particular, Revix’s Top 10 Bundle has risen over 100% since the start of 2020. <img class="size-large wp-image-366044 aligncenter" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/In-article-image-640x426.png" alt="" width="640" height="426" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/In-article-image-640x426.png 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/In-article-image-600x400.png 600w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/In-article-image-768x511.png 768w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/In-article-image-1536x1022.png 1536w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/In-article-image-1200x799.png 1200w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/In-article-image.png 1600w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> While there’s no guarantee that this past trend will continue, cryptocurrencies’ 10-year track record suggests it’s here to stay, and many believe it’s just getting started. Sanders explained, “Crypto is such a new and evolving asset class, it’s hard to guess how the market will play out in the future. If you try to gamble and pick individual winners, you could end up missing out on the Amazons or Microsofts of the crypto space.” He continued, “The long-term outperformance of our Top 10 Bundle is a reminder why taking a diversified crypto investing approach is the best strategy for most investors. Deciding where to put your money can be difficult, even for the most experienced investors. Our Bundles take the guesswork out of crypto investing, and let the winners come to you.” Revix also offers investors the ability to own Bitcoin directly, a USD stable coin called USDC, or PAX Gold, a fully backed digital token that provides direct ownership of physical gold held in London vaults, while also benefiting from zero custody and insurance fees.
