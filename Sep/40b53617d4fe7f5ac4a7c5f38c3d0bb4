Apple revealed two new iPad models at an event on 15 September – the new iPad Air and the iPad 8. Both devices feature improved hardware, with the iPad Air and iPad 8 being powered by Apple’s A14 and A12 Bionic chipsets, respectively. Apple stated that its new iPad Air is its most powerful and versatile iPad ever, and the device also sports an improved design that is available in five different colours. “Today we’re excited to introduce a completely redesigned and far more powerful iPad Air, debuting Apple’s most powerful chip ever made, the A14 Bionic,” said Apple senior vice president of worldwide marketing Greg Joswiak. “With its gorgeous new all-screen design, larger 10.9-inch Liquid Retina display, next-generation Touch ID, and a massive boost in performance with A14 Bionic, the new iPad Air brings customers powerful pro features at an even more affordable price.” Apple said that the iPad 8 is twice as fast as the top-selling Windows laptop and three-times faster than the top-selling Android tablet. Its chipset also includes Apple’s Neural Engine, which means it supports machine learning capabilities as well as real-time people occlusion and motion tracking. “We’re excited to offer customers an even faster and more powerful experience with the eighth-generation iPad,” Joswiak said. “With its beautiful 10.2-inch Retina display, the performance boost from the A12 Bionic, great cameras, and so much more, the new iPad is an incredible value at a time when, more than ever, our customers need powerful and versatile ways to work, play, learn, and connect with loved ones.” Apple’s new iPads are further detailed below. The new iPad Air is Apple’s most powerful tablet to date, and it sports an all-screen design that houses a 10.9-inch Liquid Retina display. It also has a new Touch ID sensor embedded in the top button as well as camera and audio upgrades. The iPad Air will be available in five colours: silver, space grey, rose gold, green, and sky blue. It is compatible with the Apple Magic Keyboard and the Apple Pencil, which attaches magnetically to the side of the device and charges wirelessly. The A14 Bionic chipset in the new iPad Air supports demanding workloads, allowing users to edit 4K videos, play high-resolution games, and use the built-in Neural Engine to enable machine learning applications. This chip is built on a 5nm manufacturing process and includes a four-core graphics architecture that delivers a 30% improvement in graphics performance compared to the previous generation iPad Air. The new iPad Air sports a 7MP front-facing camera and a 12MP rear camera that delivers 4K video capture. It also features a USB-C port for up to 5Gbps data transfer, as well as Wi-Fi 6 and LTE connectivity, and it is available with either 64GB or 256GB of internal storage. Apple’s new iPad Air will be available from October 2020 and will be priced as follows: Apple’s new iPad 8 tablet sports a number of improvements over the previous generation and is available in three colours: space grey, silver, and gold. The tablet sports a 10.2-inch display and all-day battery life, as well as 8MP and 1.2MP cameras on the rear and front of the device, respectively. It supports Apple’s Smart Keyboard and Apple Pencil, and a Home Button with Touch ID support rests below the display on the front of the device. The iPad 8 supports Wi-Fi or Wi-Fi + Cellular connectivity, and it is available with either 32GB or 128GB of internal storage.

These include the following: Other new functionality includes Scribble, which allows Apple Pencil users to handwrite directly in any text field. Apple Pencil integration is also improved, with Smart Selection automatically distinguishing handwriting from drawings and shape recognition, allowing users to draw shapes that are then automatically made geometrically perfect. Data detectors now work seamlessly with handwritten text, recognising phone numbers, dates, addresses, and links when they are written with the Apple Pencil.
