Eskom has confirmed that Stage 2 load-shedding will continue tomorrow because the power system is still severely constrained. This follow the power utility initiating Stage 2 load-shedding on Tuesday. “Due to the continuing severe generation supply constraints as a result of multiple unit breakdowns, Eskom will continue to implement Stage 2 load-shedding from 08:00 until 22:00 tomorrow,” said Eskom. It noted that ten generation units at seven power stations have suffered breakdowns in the past two days. “With the unreliable and aged generation infrastructure, together with a number of risks on running units, there is a high probability that additional stages of load-shedding may be implemented at short notice,” said Eskom. Eskom noted that the following power stations have suffered break downs: In total, unplanned breakdowns amount to 11,425MW of capacity, while a further 4,983MW is currently not available due to planned maintenance. “We urge the people of South Africa to help reduce electricity usage in order to assist Eskom to reduce the instance of load-shedding,” said Eskom. #PowerAlert 2
Eskom to continue implementing Stage 2 #Loadshedding from 08:00 until 22:00 tomorrow as power system is still severely constrained pic.twitter.com/JfuYcWxAyD — Eskom Hld SOC Ltd (@Eskom_SA) September 1, 2020  This news follows an interview with Eskom spokesperson Sikonathi Mantshantsha on Newzroom Afrika in which he confirmed that Eskom is planning to increase electricity prices significantly despite the loss of jobs and widespread salary cuts in the country. Mantshantsha acknowledged that load-shedding is a reason for extensive job cuts in South Africa. However, Mantshantsha explained that Eskom must invest in infrastructure to get the company back on track and end load-shedding once and for all. He said this crucial investment must be paid for, which is why Eskom needs to implement electricity price increases.
