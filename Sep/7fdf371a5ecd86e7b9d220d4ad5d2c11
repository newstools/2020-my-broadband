The Huawei MateBook D 15 is one of the best professional laptops available in South Africa, offering great performance in a slim and attractive form factor. It is powered by a powerful quad-core CPU and Radeon Vega graphics, making it more than powerful enough to handle everyday workloads. The stylish and lightweight design of the MateBook D 15 is similar to that of the Apple MacBook lineup, but it has a number of unique features that set it apart from the competition. These include a high-quality display which minimises bezels by moving the webcam to the laptop’s robust keyboard. While the MacBook’s front-facing camera rests at the top of its screen, the MateBook D 15 has a much thinner bezel and great screen-to-body ratio thanks to the innovative solution it uses for its front-facing camera. A dedicated key at the top of the keyboard can be pressed to raise or lower the MateBook D 15’s hidden camera, ensuring privacy when not in use. Another excellent feature of the Huawei MateBook D 15 is the fingerprint sensor on its power button, which lets you verify your identity quickly and easily. This is similar to the built-in fingerprint reader on the power button of Apple’s MacBook devices, and it can also be set up to work seamlessly with Windows Hello – allowing you to power up and log in at the touch of a button. The MateBook D 15 ships with a 65W USB-C fast-charger that can recharge its battery to 53% in just 30 minutes. This charger can be used to charge your smartphone, provided it also uses a USB Type-C connection. These great features, paired with the laptop’s impressive connectivity options and stylish design, make the MateBook D 15 an attractive laptop.
