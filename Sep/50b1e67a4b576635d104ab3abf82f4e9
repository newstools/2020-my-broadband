Four new TV models with various size options will be available in the country exclusively through Incredible Connection and Hi-Fi Corp. “We’re excited to announce the arrival of our TVs on South African shores, which boast the latest technologies to offer an immersive entertainment experience for fans,” said Sony Middle East and Africa head of marketing Shuichi Mugitani. “The South African market is extremely important to us, which is why we’ve made it our top priority to fit this exciting new 2020 lineup with Sony’s innovative Voice Search and remarkable premium large screens – highlighting our commitment to delivering content the way creators intended.” Sony’s new lineup of TVs comprises the A8H, X90H, X75H and X80H 4K models, each of which has a 4K resolution display.
