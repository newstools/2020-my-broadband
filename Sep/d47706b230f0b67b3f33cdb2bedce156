Alongside cloud technology, Derman also specialises in enterprise software, as well as creating new markets for new technology. Derman is a technology and human potential evangelist whose favourite topic is how these two forces will combine to form the future of AI and humanity. He describes himself as a self-motivated achiever who believes in the unlimited potential of the individual. In this discussion, Derman talks about how Kaskade.cloud was founded as a born-in-the-cloud managed service provider. He also discusses how South African businesses have increased their uptake of the cloud as a result of the national lockdown.
