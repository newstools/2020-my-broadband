Cyberpunk 2077 is set to launch on 19 November, and PC gamers now have an idea of what hardware they will need to run the highly-anticipated game. CD Projekt Red has published the official minimum and recommended system requirements for CyberPunk 2077 in its latest “Night City Wire” devblog video. The trailers for the game have shown high levels of graphical fidelity, and it is expected that you will need a powerful gaming rig to run the game at max settings, especially if you are playing at 1440p or 4K resolutions. However, the minimum requirements for the title are relatively attainable – although gamers who barely meet these specifications should not expect the next-generation graphics shown off in the developer’s gameplay trailers. CD Projekt Red also released recommended system requirements, which show what hardware you will need to run the game at decent graphics settings with good frame rates at 1080p. Below are the minimum and recommended system requirements for CyberPunk 2077. CD Projekt Red will launch Cyberpunk 2077 on 19 November for PC, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One. The game will also be launched on Google’s Stadia game streaming service before the end of 2020, and it will come to the PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S in 2021.
