South Africans now have three mobile network providers to choose from if they want to enjoy 5G connectivity – Vodacom, MTN, and Rain. Rain was the first to introduce a 5G product in South Africa back in November 2019, and was followed by Vodacom and MTN in 2020. Vodacom launched the first mobile 5G network in the country in early June and was followed by MTN later in the same month. While mmWave 5G has been able to hit a top speed of 1.8Gbps, all of the providers operate their networks on sub-6GHz spectrum. While typically only capable of providing around 100Mbps-400Mbps for download speeds, this type of 5G requires fewer installations than mmWave 5G to offer adequate coverage. Their current achievable speeds make them an attractive alternative for those who want high broadband speeds but don’t have fibre available in their area yet. Rain claims its Premium 5G package offers speeds up to 200Mbps, whereas Vodacom says its 5G network will offer 150Mbps-200Mbps given enough spectrum. MTN’s 5G offering comes in two variants, both of which claim peak speeds of 500Mbps, with average speeds as indicated below: We’ve compared the coverage and prices of Vodacom, MTN, and Rain’s 5G networks and packages below. If you are lucky enough to have coverage in your area, you will require either a 5G-capable router or smartphone to use the network. Since 5G networks are still very limited in terms of reach, it would make more sense to opt for a router which will be kept in one location. Both Vodacom and MTN offer 5G packages with routers on either 24- or 36-month contracts, while Rain provides a free-to-use router on its month-to-month 5G products. When it comes to data allocation,  only MTN and Rain feature uncapped 5G packages, although it should be noted that the former comes with a 200GB fair usage policy (FUP). MTN’s uncapped 5G package is priced at R1,249 on a 24-month contract and R999 over 36 months, while Rain charges R999 for its Premium Uncapped package. The table below shows all of the 5G packages available from these three operators that are bundled with a 5G router.  R1,499 x 36 Vodacom’s 5G network initially went live at 20 sites across Johannesburg,  Pretoria, and Cape Town. These 20 sites grouped into six clusters – Midrand, Sandton, Menlyn, Centurion, Waterfall/Sunninghill, and Century City – as shown in the images below.
