Four high-profile MultiChoice executives have resigned or have left the company in recent weeks, raising questions as to what is behind these departures. This week, MultiChoice announced that the CEO of its South African operations, Mark Rayner, had resigned to “further his journey outside the group”. The company said Rayner will leave MultiChoice on 30 November 2020 and that his successor will be announced “in the near future”. This follows shortly after the resignation of MultiChoice Connected Video CEO Niclas Ekdahl in June to “pursue personal interests”. Yolisa Phahle will take over Ekdahl’s position, in addition to running the General Entertainment division. Other departures include MultiChoice Group chief strategy officer Max Krudop and MultiChoice Connected Video head of communications Richard Boorman. The exodus of high-profile executives at MultiChoice sparked speculation that there may be something more to these resignations than meets the eye. One theory is that MultiChoice CEO Calvo Mawela’s management style and strategic direction for the company led to the resignations. There is also speculation that some of the resignations and departures were not planned, but this could not be confirmed. MyBroadband asked MultiChoice about the spate of high-profile departures at the company, and it said: Over the last while we have reflected on our ways of work and structure focusing on our efficiencies within the group. As part of this process, we have had some voluntary departures. We will continue to strive for efficiencies going forward. Here is a quick overview of the high-profile MultiChoice resignations and departures in recent weeks. MultiChoice South Africa CEO Mark Rayner joined the company 2007, where he served as the CFO of DStv Mobile until September 2008, after which he took the helm at the company. As CEO of DStv Mobile, he oversaw the introduction of various mobile television services across the African continent. In November 2013, Rayner was appointed as the chief operating officer of MultiChoice South Africa and was promoted to CEO in May 2016. <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-366478" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Mark-Rayner.jpg" alt="Mark-Rayner" width="640" height="430" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Mark-Rayner.jpg 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Mark-Rayner-595x400.jpg 595w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Mark-Rayner-300x202.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> MultiChoice Connected Video CEO Niclas Ekdahl was appointed to the position in September 2018.
