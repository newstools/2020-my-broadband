MyBroadband has helped hundreds of South African IT and telecoms companies to increase their brand awareness and sign up new customers. To ensure companies get the best return on investment (ROI) on their marketing spend, MyBroadband has a simple strategy: An important ingredient in this strategy is to tell the target audience which problem is solved instead of just telling them about the products offered. This message is tailored to engage the audience and tell them how the products can add value to them and their company. It is then distributed to the right audience through MyBroadband’s digital and social media channels using the latest targeting tools. The results from these campaigns are excellent. They create excellent brand awareness among the desired audiences and experienced far higher engagement rates. Codehesion partnered with MyBroadband to increase the company’s brand awareness and to send potential clients to its website. The target audience is business owners and executives who are the ICT decision makers in their company (CEOs, CTOs, CIOs, and IT managers). The campaign created a simple message to tell the target audience about Codehesion’s strengths and how they can help companies to get a world-class mobile app. To distribute this message MyBroadband used a combination of sponsored content, newsletters, social media promotions, and mobile banners. The results were exceptional. MyBroadband sent a large number of business owners and executives to Codehesion’s website, which resulted in many qualified leads and millions of rands in business.
