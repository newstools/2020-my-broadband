Samsung has officially launched its new foldable smartphone – the Galaxy Z Fold 2 – in South Africa. The Galaxy Z Fold 2 was originally revealed during the company’s Unpacked event last month, where Samsung launched its Galaxy Note series smartphones, but the release date and specifications for the foldable smartphone were not disclosed. This new foldable device sports a similar look to the original Galaxy Fold, but offers a number of new features and design improvements. Samsung has now provided more information on the launch date of the Galaxy Z Fold 2, as well as its hardware specifications. The Galaxy Z Fold 2 will be available in South Africa from 25 September and will be priced at R49,999. The company added that the Galaxy Z Fold 2 will be available for pre-order from 7 September. Samsung South Africa is in talks with mobile operators regarding the contract pricing of the smartphone, stating that it expects the postpaid price of the device to be around R2,799 per month. Samsung has said that its new foldable smartphone “combines the portability and flexibility of a smartphone with the power and screen size of a tablet for ultimate productivity”. “Whether folded or unfolded, you can enjoy a luxury mobile experience with Galaxy Z Fold 2’s premium design,” the company said. This new foldable smartphone is equipped with two edge-to-edge Infinity-O displays, one on the outside and one on the inside of the device. The exterior (or “cover”) screen is 6.2 inches in size and the primary screen is 7.6 inches. These are both larger than the displays on the original Galaxy Fold. The display is now made of thin glass instead of the old plastic material used on the first wave of folding smartphones. Samsung has also continued to improve its folding smartphone design, offering a more durable hinge that is more resistant to dust and other particles interfering with its movement. The new hinge also lets users change the position of the display, which is useful when combined with the different configurations enabled by Samsung’s Flex UI software. Samsung said the Galaxy Z Fold 2 will support 5G network connectivity and will be available in two colours – Mystic Bronze and Mystic Black. The Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 2 is powered by a Qualcomm Snapdragon 865+ mobile chipset which supports 5G network connectivity as well as Wi-Fi 6 and Bluetooth 5.1. A rear triple-camera system comprising three 12MP sensors is contained in a large rectangular bump on the rear of the device. This camera system boasts impressive photography capabilities including the ability to record 4K video at 60FPS, as well as HDR photography support. A 10MP single front-facing camera sits on the cover display, with an identical selfie camera set into the main folding display. Other specifications include 12GB of RAM, 256GB of internal storage, and a USB Type-C 3.1 connector for fast wired charging and data transfer. The full specifications of the device are shown below. <img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-362808" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Samsung-Galaxy-Fold-2-5G-1-640x430.jpg" alt="Samsung Galaxy Fold 2 5G 1" width="640" height="430" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Samsung-Galaxy-Fold-2-5G-1.jpg 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Samsung-Galaxy-Fold-2-5G-1-595x400.jpg 595w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Samsung-Galaxy-Fold-2-5G-1-300x202.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> <img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-362814" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Samsung-Galaxy-Fold-2-5G-4-640x430.jpg" alt="Samsung Galaxy Fold 2 5G 4" width="640" height="430" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Samsung-Galaxy-Fold-2-5G-4.jpg 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Samsung-Galaxy-Fold-2-5G-4-595x400.jpg 595w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Samsung-Galaxy-Fold-2-5G-4-300x202.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> <img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-362812" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Samsung-Galaxy-Fold-2-5G-3-640x430.jpg" alt="Samsung Galaxy Fold 2 5G 3Samsung Galaxy Fold 2 5G 3" width="640" height="430" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Samsung-Galaxy-Fold-2-5G-3.jpg 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Samsung-Galaxy-Fold-2-5G-3-595x400.jpg 595w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Samsung-Galaxy-Fold-2-5G-3-300x202.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> <img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-362810" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Samsung-Galaxy-Fold-2-5G-2-640x430.jpg" alt="Samsung Galaxy Fold 2 5G 2" width="640" height="430" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Samsung-Galaxy-Fold-2-5G-2.jpg 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Samsung-Galaxy-Fold-2-5G-2-595x400.jpg 595w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Samsung-Galaxy-Fold-2-5G-2-300x202.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" />
