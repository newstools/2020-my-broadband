Eskom has launched a new portal where South Africans can view the system status and other related data. This follows requests from OUTA to Eskom to make its power system performance information publicly available in a user-friendly form. OUTA said it has spent months trying to get this information. “Eskom initially delayed responding, then refused our request,” it said. On 3 April, OUTA filed an application in terms of the Promotion of Access to Information Act (PAIA) with Eskom. They asked for a list of specified power system performance information to be made available to the public. The information requested included hourly details on energy produced by each power station, details of availability, planned maintenance, unplanned breakdowns, and emissions. “Five months after we asked for a list of power system performance information on the state of the Eskom to be made public, it has finally made a limited amount available to the public,” OUTA said. “Although this is a good start, the information now provided is still far from what is provided by Eskom’s peers around the world,” said Chris Yelland, OUTA’s energy advisor. Yelland said the power system performance information is important for the electricity customers, business, mining, industry, and the general public to know. “In addition, the public cannot simply be expected to watch idly as billions of rand in taxpayer money go to bailing out Eskom over the next decade,” he said. Yelland provided a preliminary assessment of the Eskom data in comparison with what OUTA asked for: “It is OUTA’s view that Eskom should focus on providing a comprehensive, automated, hourly, raw data feed,” Yelland said. “The benefits of increased transparency, benchmarking, public and peer pressure would be an enormous driver for positive performance improvement and attitude change within Eskom.” The charts below provide an overview of some of the data which Eskom is currently providing. The chart indicates how the actual demand during lockdown compares to what the expected demand was before the lockdown was announced. It can be seen that there was a significant reduction in demand, which gradually reduced as we moved to lower levels. <img class="aligncenter wp-image-366520 size-large" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Lockdown-demand-tracking-640x299.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="299" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Lockdown-demand-tracking-640x299.jpg 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Lockdown-demand-tracking-600x280.jpg 600w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Lockdown-demand-tracking-768x359.jpg 768w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Lockdown-demand-tracking.jpg 1160w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> Weekly peak demand is shown for the current and previous financial year.
