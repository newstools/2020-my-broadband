Openserve CEO Althon Beukes said the company has a long-standing and important relationship with Telenor. “Their extensive roaming coverage combined with the vast experience and competence is significant in providing our end users with the desired roaming experience,” Beukes said. “Partnering with one of the world’s major mobile groups such as Telenor helps us to scale our retail roaming services and improve operational efficiency, which is very important to cater for our corporate and leisure travellers in South Africa.” Telenor said it would ensure that this agreement would result in an improved roaming agreement for Openserve’s end-users. “We are delighted to support Telkom with reduced wholesale roaming cost as well as operational cost.
