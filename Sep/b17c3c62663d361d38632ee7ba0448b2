MTN has announced it now offers a month-to-month payment option on its SIM-only packages. The payment option requires no long-term contract lock-in, credit checks, or completing complicated paperwork, the operator said. “MTN Month-to-Month is available to anyone that either doesn’t want to be tied to a contract or who is unable to get a long-term contract due to not meeting minimum requirements,” the operator stated. MTN Executive Head for Corporate Affairs Jacqui O’Sullivan said the product was launched in response to customers’ needs for greater flexibility. “We developed this offer with freelancers, entrepreneurs, independent contractors, and part-time temporary workers, who live from contract to contract, in mind and we hope it can help alleviate some of the pressure being felt by so many right now,” O’Sullivan said. The month-to-month option is available starting from 1 September. New or existing MTN customers will be able to choose this payment when taking out SIM-only deals that are also offered on a 24-month contract basis. They will be required to provide their name and South African ID, in addition to debit order details, if they wish to pay on a month-to-month basis. Long-term contracts typically offer data and airtime at lower prices than on prepaid packages. However, in the event that a customer is dissatisfied with their package or a more attractive alternative is available, they are forced to pay a hefty cancellation fee to terminate the contract. The contract application also requires the customer to undergo a credit check and provide supporting documents to prove that they will be able to make the payments. On a month-to-month payment plan, the customer has the option to cancel their package at any time and no credit check is needed.
