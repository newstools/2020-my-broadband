Eskom has denied accusations that it is deliberately deceiving the public on which load-shedding stages it is implementing. This comes after energy advisor Ted Blom accused Eskom of lying about its load-shedding levels. Speaking to the SABC, Blom said Eskom had implemented stage 6 load-shedding on Thursday night without informing the public. He said official Eskom records show the power utility shed in excess of 5,600MW at around 18:30 on 3 September. Under the current definition, this equates to stage 6 load-shedding, where between 5,000MW and 6,000MW is shed. According to Blom, this data showed that Eskom implemented stage 6 load-shedding while people were under the impression that stage 4 load-shedding was in progress. Blom accused Eskom of deliberately under-reporting the load-shedding stages for the past month. “I don’t know what’s wrong with the new leadership – whether they want to deceive the public or whether it is a board policy that they have changed their categories,” he said. He explained this lack of transparency from Eskom is causing confusion among South Africans who may be experiencing load-shedding when they do not expect it. The table below shows the load-shedding information shared by Eskom spokesperson Sikonathi Mantshantsha which Blom is referring to. Mantshantsha confirmed he publishes regular statistics about Eskom’s performance during times of load-shedding. “Those statistics show the amount of power produced and the amount of load-shedding,” Mantshantsha said. He denied that the figures show that Eskom is deliberately deceiving the public on which load-shedding stages it is implementing. “Ted Blom knows, or ought to know, that in terms of Nersa’s rule NRS 048-9 once Eskom declares Stage 4 load-shedding, it can request any major industrial customer to curtail up to 20% of load,” Mantshantsha said. “This amounts to 1,200MW of demand that must be curtailed by industrial customers as part of the licenced load curtailment in terms.” Load-shedding is what Eskom sheds from the public, and that is what Eskom announced at Stage 4 on Thursday. <span data-mce-type="bookmark" style="display: inline-block; width: 0px; overflow: hidden; line-height: 0;" class="mce_SELRES_start">﻿</span>  Evening Peak Feedback on 03/09/2020 at 18:39
