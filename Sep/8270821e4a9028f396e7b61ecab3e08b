Google has launched its latest flagship smartphone, the Pixel 5, as well as a 5G version of its Pixel 4a device. The Pixel 5 is the most capable handset Google has ever released in terms of connectivity and features, and it sports a modern design with thin bezels and an edge-to-edge display. The device has a punch-hole notch for its front-facing camera, and it sports a square dual-camera array on the back of its all-aluminium chassis. The Google Pixel 5 is available in two colours – Just Black and Sorta Sage – and will be priced at $699. Google said the smartphone will be available in 9 countries from 15 October. South Africa is not listed among the countries that will receive the Pixel 5. Google’s Pixel 5 is powered by a Snapdragon 765G with 8GB of RAM and 128GB of internal storage.

Google’s Pixel 5 sports a new ultra-wide lens on the back in addition to its primary dual-pixel lens, and the company has added its Night Sight low-light photography feature to its front camera. “Ask any Pixel owner and they’ll tell you: Pixels take great photos,” Google said. “Pixel 4a (5G) and Pixel 5 are no exception. These phones bring Pixel’s industry-leading photography features to the next level.” The smartphone includes software-based portrait lighting and a new editor in Google Photos that also helps to improve the lighting of subjects. It also has a new Hold for Me feature which allows your Google Assistant to wait in line for you when calling toll-free numbers. A number of these features will also be available for older Pixel smartphones in the near future, Google said.
