Appleâ€™s new 27-inch iMacs are now available from the iStore in South Africa. The 2020 iMacs were unveiled in early August and they boast faster Intel processors, double the maximum memory capacity, new AMD graphics, and SSD storage across the range. The screen has also been updated to a Retina 5K display, with the option of a nano-texture glass panel that improves viewing in bright conditions. The iStore is offering three 27-inch iMac models, with options of either 6-core Intel Core i5 processors or an 8-core Core i7 chip. The two Core i5 configurations both come with 8GB DDR4 RAM and Radeon Pro 5300 graphics, and either 256GB or 512GB of SSD storage. The Intel Core i7 model is fitted with 8GB DDR4 RAM, Radeon Pro 5500XT graphics, and a 512GB SSD. Below are the prices for each model available from the iStore: Trade-ins of old iMacs are also open, with iStore noting that swapping a particular 2017 version with Retina 5K display, Core i5-7500, 8GB RAM, and 1TB Fusion storage will bring the price of the new entry-level iMac down to R26,999. The table below shows the specifications available on the new 27-inch iMac models in South Africa. <img class="aligncenter wp-image-362654" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Apple_imac-macos-photos-days-darkmode_08042020.jpg" alt="Apple iMac 27-inch Retina 5K" width="640" height="533" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Apple_imac-macos-photos-days-darkmode_08042020.jpg 1960w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Apple_imac-macos-photos-days-darkmode_08042020-480x400.jpg 480w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Apple_imac-macos-photos-days-darkmode_08042020-516x430.jpg 516w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Apple_imac-macos-photos-days-darkmode_08042020-768x639.jpg 768w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Apple_imac-macos-photos-days-darkmode_08042020-1536x1279.jpg 1536w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Apple_imac-macos-photos-days-darkmode_08042020-1200x999.jpg 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> <img class="aligncenter wp-image-362652" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Apple_imac-macos-logicpro_08042020.jpg" alt="Apple iMac 27-inch editing" width="640" height="533" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Apple_imac-macos-logicpro_08042020.jpg 1960w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Apple_imac-macos-logicpro_08042020-480x400.jpg 480w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Apple_imac-macos-logicpro_08042020-516x430.jpg 516w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Apple_imac-macos-logicpro_08042020-768x639.jpg 768w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Apple_imac-macos-logicpro_08042020-1536x1279.jpg 1536w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Apple_imac-macos-logicpro_08042020-1200x999.jpg 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> <img class="aligncenter wp-image-362650" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Apple_imac-macos-facetime_08042020.jpg" alt="Apple iMac 27-inch camera" width="640" height="533" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Apple_imac-macos-facetime_08042020.jpg 1960w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Apple_imac-macos-facetime_08042020-480x400.jpg 480w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Apple_imac-macos-facetime_08042020-516x430.jpg 516w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Apple_imac-macos-facetime_08042020-768x639.jpg 768w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Apple_imac-macos-facetime_08042020-1536x1279.jpg 1536w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Apple_imac-macos-facetime_08042020-1200x999.jpg 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" />
