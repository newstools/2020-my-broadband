The majority of tech-savvy South Africans who have Netflix have a fibre Internet connection at home. This was one of the findings of the Netflix 2020 Survey conducted by MyBroadband. The survey was completed by 1,867 tech-savvy South Africans and provides an excellent overview of the local market. Of those who took part in the survey, 80% said they subscribe to Netflix. Of these users, 53% said they have a Netflix Premium subscription. An interesting finding from the survey was that of the Netflix users who took part, just over 60% said they had fibre connectivity at home. Many local ISPs offer fibre packages with uncapped data usage, stable speeds of 10Mbps and up, and low latencies – which is an ideal combination for users who want to stream video without worrying about data usage or slowing down other Internet-connected devices at home. LTE and ADSL/VDSL were well behind fibre in terms of popularity, with 17% and 12% of respondents, respectively. 5G, WISP, and mobile data were the remaining connection technologies – with only a small percentage of respondents using these.
