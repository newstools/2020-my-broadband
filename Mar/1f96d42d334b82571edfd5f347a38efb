Altron Nexus has announced the appointment of a new permanent managing director, Mark Harris. Andrew Holden, Group COO, said that Harris would report directly to him. “Mark has been acting as Altron Nexus MD for almost six months – we are seeing some gains brought about by his leadership particularly with regards to how we connect with our customers,” said Holden. “We are thrilled to have him join us and are certain that Mark will add significant value to our business moving forward.” The company said Harris has had an illustrious career in ICT and leadership, having led Kagiso Media’s digital transformation strategy and implementation of shared services. He has also held senior executive roles at IBM locally and abroad, said the company. The news follows three senior executives at Altron Nexus being been placed on precautionary suspension in 2019, after an investigation revealed potential internal irregularities. In June 2019, parent company Altron said it received a tip-off from a whistle-blower regarding the irregularities. The preliminary findings revealed “possible deviation from procurement processes” involving an estimated R23 million, and early profit recognition of approximately R20 million in the 2018 financial year. Altron Group CEO Mteto Nyati said the company viewed the allegations in a serious light. Altron previously received information of alleged procurement irregularities at Altron Nexus from a whistle-blower in June 2018 and appointed independent investigators to look into the matter – but found no evidence of irregularities at the time. <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-340859" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Mark-Harris.jpg" alt="Mark Harris" width="640" height="430" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Mark-Harris.jpg 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Mark-Harris-595x400.jpg 595w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Mark-Harris-300x202.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" />
