The World Health Organisation (WHO) has launched a free-to-use WHO Health Alert chatbot on WhatsApp. This service aims to keep the public informed about the worldwide spread of the COVID-19 coronavirus, and it can also answer questions from users about the pandemic. The WHO Health Alert will provide guidance on topics such as how to protect yourself from infection, travel advice, and debunking coronavirus myths. It is currently only available in English but will add support for Arabic, Chinese, French, Russian, and Spanish over the coming weeks. “Digital technology gives us an unprecedented opportunity for vital health information to go viral and spread faster than the pandemic, helping us save lives and protect the vulnerable,” said WHO director-general Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus. “We are proud to have partners like Facebook and WhatsApp, that are supporting us in reaching billions of people with important health information.” To add the WHO Health Alert chatbot to your WhatsApp application, follow the steps below. Once you have activated the service, you can send it questions about the COVID-19 coronavirus and navigate through text menus for more information and updates on the outbreak.
