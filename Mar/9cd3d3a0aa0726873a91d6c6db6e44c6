Microsoft has given users a first look at its upcoming redesign for the Windows 10 Start menu. During a Windows Insider webcast, the company showed off an early version of the new design concept which was still under development. This new design reduces the prominence of Live Tiles in favour of standard icons, making the tiles smaller and removing the coloured backgrounds for each tile to better fit the user’s theme. “The idea is to visually unify the Start menu from a somewhat chaotic colour to something a bit more uniform,” said one of the Microsoft designers during the webcast. Windows Insider programme manager Brandon LeBlanc said that users will still be able to use Live Tiles, but they would be less intrusive for users who did not use them. The upcoming Start menu aims to deliver a consistent design across both dark and light themes. Microsoft has also been working on a new operating system designed for dual-screen and foldable devices named Windows 10X. This version of the Windows 10 operating system will use large icons and fonts for easier navigation using a touch interface. For example, long-pressing on a file will bring up a basic context menu with options to delete, cut, copy, share, rename, and view properties. Windows 10X will also include two versions of File Explorer – one for traditional Win32 applications and one for Universal Windows Platform (UWP) apps that can be downloaded from the Microsoft Store. According to Microsoft’s typical release schedule, Windows 10X is expected to ship with compatible devices in April or May 2020.
