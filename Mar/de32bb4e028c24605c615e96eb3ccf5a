Uber South Africa has published its annual Uber Lost and Found Index – detailing a list of the most common and unique items riders leave behind in its drivers’ cars. The ride-hailing service provided a number of facts around the items which local riders lose, as well as in which cities and at what times items are typically forgotten in vehicles. “In 2019, phones, wallets, keys and headphones once again topped the list of most commonly forgotten items, with backpacks, clothing, glasses and vapes following suit,” Uber said. In addition to the most commonly lost items, Uber revealed that riders in South Africa have left behind a number of strange items. These included a braai stand, plasma TVs, a breast pump with breast milk, a grinding machine, and a scanner. Additionally, the Index shows in which cities the most people forgot items, as well as the times of day and days of the week when riders were most likely to leave items behind. “Durban and Johannesburg are tied for the number one spot, followed closely by Cape Town and Port Elizabeth,” Uber noted. “The Index shows riders are most forgetful on Fridays and Thursdays, and late at night – but the most common hours, specifically are 20:00 – perhaps during the rush to make dinner reservations – and from 16:00 to 19:00,” Uber added. Uber advised riders that the best recourse for recovering lost items was to call their driver. If, however, your phone is the item you lost, you can log into your account from your computer and follow these steps to retrieve your item: Below are lists of the top 10 most commonly forgotten items, the top 20 most unique items lost, the most forgetful cities, and the times and days items are most often left behind in Uber vehicles.
