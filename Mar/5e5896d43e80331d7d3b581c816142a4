Renault has unveiled a futuristic concept electric vehicle that can be physically extended to allow for extra batteries. The Renault Morphoz is an all-electric adaptive crossover SUV which is charged wirelessly via induction chargers located in roads, public car parks, or at home. “This futuristic vehicle represents Renault’s vision of personal, shareable electric mobility in the years beyond 2025,” the company said. In City Mode, the length of the car is 4.4m, which gives it a battery capacity of 40kWh. Renault said this will provide sufficient power for 400km of range, more than enough for average travelling in town. If, however, the owner needs more range to cover greater distances, the car can be taken to a special station to add additional capacity. The car can be transformed into Travel Mode, extending its length to 4.8m. A flap in the flat floor undertray of the car opens above the station’s flap, after which 50kWh of batteries are installed in the vehicle in “just a few seconds”. This provides the Morphoz with a maximum range of 700km. Once the trip is done, the owner can then return to the station to have the extra batteries removed. The Morphoz packs a load of other innovative features. When a driver approaches the vehicle, a light sequence is initiated to notify them that they have been detected and recognised by the vehicle’s sensors. The driver can then simply wave to unlock the vehicle and open its reverse-hinged doors. Inside the car, the driver will find a 10.2-inch display located in the steering wheel, which displays main driving and safety information. Behind the steering wheel is a surround dashboard which appears to be devoid of any instrument panels or screens. However, upon the driver’s request, the dashboard opens to let the Livingscreen instrument panel fold out. “This single, wide-screen displays both the driving and the multimedia system information,” Renault explained. There is no B-pillar located between the front and rear doors, which Renault said would make it easier for passengers to get into the compartment. The front passenger seat’s “Share” mode allows it to swivel to face the rear seats. The rear seats automatically slide back when the car is converted from City to Travel mode, providing passengers with more legroom. In the centre of the compartment, passengers will find a console with built-in screen which can be used as a table. The Morphoz supports level three autonomous driving functions, as defined by the SAE (Society of Automotive Engineers) International organisation. This means the driver is allowed to let go of the steering wheel and delegate the driving to the vehicle in certain defined situations on authorised roads, such as on a motorway or in traffic jams. “The driver is free to move their eyes and hands once delegation has been made. He can use the car’s multimedia system to dictate e-mails, text messages or play multimedia content, for example,” Renault explained.
