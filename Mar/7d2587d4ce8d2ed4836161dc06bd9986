The Department of Cooperative and Government Affairs has published new regulations which outline the essential services which will be allowed to continue operating during South Africa’s 21-day coronavirus lockdown. Companies that are essential to the production and transportation of food, basic goods and medical supplies will remain open during the 21-day ‘lockdown’, president Cyril Ramaphosa announced during his national address on 23 March. These personnel will be exempted from the stay-home provisions as they are vital for continued functioning of these companies during the lockdown, he said. The regulations make provisions for the following 28 jobs: In an interview with 702, Transport minister Fikile Mbalula said that all of these workers – including those who use private transport – will have to carry a permit showing that they are classified as ‘essential’ and are allowed to be on the roads. All employers will be expected to generate permits for special workers,” he said. “If for example, you are working in a supermarket, Pick n Pay will have to produce a permit for each worker that shows you are permitted to work on this day in terms of the regulation and the lockdown. That will also happen (for other essential services) such as the media. As ministers, we have been given a guide and asked to define what is essential work and we have done that for our different departments.” Those who need a permit to work as an essential service will need to fill out Annexure C of the regulations.
