South African filmmaker Dan Mace has released a video on YouTube describing how his infection with the coronavirus that causes COVID-19 went undiagnosed and undetected. It is not clear exactly when he contracted the virus or whether he was infectious when he flew from Los Angeles to Cape Town. Mace is known for short-film format advertising campaigns for which he won three Young Director Awards in two years at Cannes Lions. He also directed “This Is Your Time“, a short film to advertise Vodacom South Africa’s NXT LVL services aimed at young people. More recently, Mace quit his career in advertising to launch a YouTube channel. He began his YouTube career in New York City, in partnership with Casey Neistat. Mace and Neistat later moved to Los Angeles. Mace explained that he returned to Cape Town from Los Angeles for his wedding, which they postponed when he tested positive for SARS-CoV-2, the coronavirus that causes COVID-19. He received his diagnosis on 21 March 2020. “I would like to share my story, my symptoms, and insights I have gained for the purpose of scientific research and, in hope, to help save lives,” Mace stated in his video. According to Mace, the timeline leading up to his diagnosis was as follows: Mace said that if he got the virus while he was in the United States, he hopes that he was past the infectious stage by the time he boarded the plane to Dubai, and from Dubai to Cape Town. “I just hope that my story can somehow help others out there,” he said.
