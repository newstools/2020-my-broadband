Etv’s free-to-air satellite broadcasting service Openview features several digital TV channels and radio stations. The Openview service offers 16 TV channels and 9 radio stations, which boast entertainment that includes movies, TV shows, news and sports. According to Openview, the service is currently activated in almost 2 million homes in South Africa. It said that its movie channels – eMovies and eExtra – are particularly popular, while Afrikaans titles, court series, and Indian telenovelas enjoy good viewership as well. Openview said users get “crystal-clear picture”, with most of its channels available in HD. DStv does have a significant advantage in its sports offering, as it boasts rights to the broadcasting of many of the most popular sports, including football, rugby and cricket. In addition to certain local sports that are available from the public broadcaster, Openview also offers a limited selection of international sports. In August 2019, Openview announced it would be broadcasting Premier League football matches live on its News & Sport channel. These include at least one game featuring one of the six high-profile football clubs each week – Manchester City, Liverpool, Chelsea, Tottenham Hotspur, Arsenal, and Manchester United. Additionally, the channel has the rights to broadcast other football-related magazine programmes that are produced by the Premier League. The Fight Sports TV channel also broadcasts combat sports such as boxing, kickboxing, Judo, Sumo, and Karate. Openview is available for a once-off fee of R1,399 – which includes the satellite, decoder, and installation costs. No other monthly costs are applicable to the service. Those who already have a satellite dish installed, can buy only the decoder at R499. The decoder features Open PVR, which lets users record their favourite shows and movies.
