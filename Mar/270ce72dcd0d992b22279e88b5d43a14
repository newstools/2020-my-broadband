The National Department of Health (DoH) on Thursday confirmed the first case of the COVID-19 coronavirus in South Africa. “This morning, Thursday March 5, the National Institute for Communicable Diseases confirmed that a suspected case of COVID-19 has tested positive,” said the department. The virus was contracted by a 38-year-old male who had visited Italy with his wife and arrived back in the country on 1 March. South Africa is the latest addition to a list of at least 84 countries who have confirmed cases of the virus. In humans, the virus causes mild to severe respiratory illness, which could be fatal. The World Health Organisation (WHO) recently raised the alert for the COVID-19 outbreak to “very high at a global level” – the highest level of risk assessment in terms of spread and impact. Al Jazeera reported there are more than 93,000 confirmed cases of the virus around the world – the majority of which are in China, where the disease originated. According to Pharmaceutical Technology, there have been over 3,300 deaths due to COVID-19, while more than 53,000 people have recovered from the disease. On 3 March, the WHO put the official fatality rate for the disease at 3.4%. Most of the deaths were reported in China, while Italy, Iran and the United States have also confirmed fatalities.
