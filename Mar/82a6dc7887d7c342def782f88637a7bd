When ASUS released its new lineup of devices in South Africa, one of the highlights was the ZenBook 14. The company spent the past few years crafting a device to suit the everyday creative professional and they did not disappoint. The 14-inch notebook is one of the smallest and lightest devices in the ASUS range and does not compromise on ports or power. With its military-grade durability, it is sturdy enough to operate in the harshest of environments, yet slick enough to fit into any office setup. ASUS was kind enough to send MyBroadband one of these laptops to review, and we took it through its paces. The ZenBook 14 boasts a 14-inch frameless Full HD touch-screen with an exceptional 92% screen-to-body ratio. ASUS also went the extra mile with its unique ErgoLift hinge that automatically tilts the device allowing for the most comfortable typing position. Additionally, this also delivers more effective cooling as well as an enhanced audio experience. The excellent build quality is immediately apparent when using the laptop, and the combination of the frameless screen with the ErgoLift hinge makes a big difference when typing for long periods. ASUS also partnered with Harman Kardon to deliver smart amplifier technology that delivers louder sound with no distortion at max volume. The exterior of the device sports a colour choice of either Royal Blue or Icicle Silver, both of which are enhanced complemented a thin, luxurious Rose Gold panel above the keyboard. Both variations include the classic ASUS etching on the lid. The ZenBook 14 introduces the ScreenPad 2.0, a remodelled version of the contemporary touchpad which functions almost like a smartphone and can act as your task manager. This allows for more space and enhances mobility. Conveniently, in the bottom left corner is a key which allows you to switch the ScreenPad to a regular touchpad. The revised ScreenPad was great to use â€“ ASUS was able to create something elegant but also practical. Our unit came with Windows 10 Pro, an 8th-generation Intel Core i7 CPU, 16GB of DDR4 RAM, a 1TB solid-state drive (SSD), and an Nvidia GeForce MX250 graphics card. The laptop also offers plenty of options in terms of ports and expandability. On the right side of the ZenBook 14 is a standard 3.5mm audio jack, a USB 2.0 port, and a MicroSD card reader. On the left side of the device is a USB 3.1 Gen 2 port, a USB-C port, an HDMI port, and the DC port used to charge the device. For those who prefer wired connectivity, included in the box is an Ethernet-to-USB adaptor which simply plugs into one of the USB ports. At the time of writing this article, the ASUS ZenBook 14 was available on Takealot for the discounted price of R15,499. The table below shows the specifications of the ASUS ZenBook 14 that we tested. <img class="aligncenter wp-image-340885 size-large" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/ASUS-ZenBook-1420-640x427.jpg" alt="ASUS ZenBook 14" width="640" height="427" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/ASUS-ZenBook-1420-640x427.jpg 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/ASUS-ZenBook-1420-600x400.jpg 600w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/ASUS-ZenBook-1420-768x512.jpg 768w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/ASUS-ZenBook-1420.jpg 1050w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> <img class="aligncenter wp-image-340879 size-large" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/ASUS-ZenBook-1408-640x427.jpg" alt="ASUS ZenBook 14" width="640" height="427" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/ASUS-ZenBook-1408-640x427.jpg 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/ASUS-ZenBook-1408-600x400.jpg 600w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/ASUS-ZenBook-1408-768x512.jpg 768w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/ASUS-ZenBook-1408.jpg 1050w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> <img class="aligncenter wp-image-340883 size-large" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/ASUS-ZenBook-1418-640x427.jpg" alt="ASUS ZenBook 14" width="640" height="427" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/ASUS-ZenBook-1418-640x427.jpg 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/ASUS-ZenBook-1418-600x400.jpg 600w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/ASUS-ZenBook-1418-768x512.jpg 768w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/ASUS-ZenBook-1418.jpg 1050w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> <img class="aligncenter wp-image-340881 size-large" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/ASUS-ZenBook-1413-640x427.jpg" alt="ASUS ZenBook 14" width="640" height="427" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/ASUS-ZenBook-1413-640x427.jpg 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/ASUS-ZenBook-1413-600x400.jpg 600w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/ASUS-ZenBook-1413-768x512.jpg 768w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/ASUS-ZenBook-1413.jpg 1050w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> <img class="aligncenter wp-image-340877" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/ASUS-ZenBook-1406.jpg" alt="ASUS ZenBook 14" width="640" height="451" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/ASUS-ZenBook-1406.jpg 994w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/ASUS-ZenBook-1406-568x400.jpg 568w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/ASUS-ZenBook-1406-611x430.jpg 611w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/ASUS-ZenBook-1406-768x541.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" />
