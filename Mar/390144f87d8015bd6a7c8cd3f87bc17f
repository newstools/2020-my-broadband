South Africans continue to use more mobile data each month, especially with the growth in video use on smartphones. Vodacom’s latest results show that the average data use per device is now 1.3GB – a 53% increase over the last year. There has also been a 54.6% growth in traffic on the Vodacom network which illustrates the increased demand for data. Millions of South Africans purchase smaller data bundles of up to 1GB for messaging and web surfing. Middle-class citizens with high-end smartphones are, however, looking for enough data for video and audio streaming. The good news is that all mobile operators are offering large data bundles for affordable prices on 24-month contracts. These data bundles start at R149 for 10GB from Vodacom and increase to R999 for 100GB from MTN. The table below provides a summary of the best big data deals in South Africa. It shows that Vodacom and MTN offer the best value-for-money, while Cell C is the most expensive for big data bundles.
