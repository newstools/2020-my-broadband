The 21-day lockdown in South Africa came into effect this morning and several people have been arrested for breaching its restrictions. Regulations related to the lockdown prohibit the sale of alcohol and gatherings of any kind during the period. People are also not allowed to go jogging, walk their dog in public, or move between districts or provinces. There are also restrictions on visiting cinemas, bars and shebeens, restaurants, hotels, nightclubs, lodges, and beaches – many of which are closed for the lockdown. Police Minister Bheki Cele warned that those who break the rules will be arrested and face a fine or even jail time. Several hours into the lockdown in South Africa, and arrests have already been made at establishments which broke the rules this morning. SABC News covered the arrests, with people who visited a tavern in Hillbrow arrested in the early hours of Friday morning. The manager of the tavern was also arrested. Comments regarding these arrested were mostly positive. “I’m so glad South Africa’s government is taking this seriously. If they don’t, it will become like Italy,” said one person. “Irresponsible, immature and selfish. This is an opportunity to be creative in so many ways. Explore their potential. Excellent work SAPS,” said another.
