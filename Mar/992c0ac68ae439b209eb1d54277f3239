iStore has announced that the GPS + Cellular version of the Apple Watch Series 5 will be launched in South Africa. Apple unveiled its latest smartwatch on 10 September 2019, with both a GPS-only and GPS + Cellular version released. Up to now, only the GPS variant of the Apple Watch Series 5 has been available in South Africa. The cellular version supports eSIM technology, allowing users to stay connected to a mobile network without the need to be linked to their smartphone. Users are able to make phone calls, send text messages, and stream music directly from their watch. The Apple Watch Series 5 with cellular will be available from iStore, and users will be able to use the eSIM functionality exclusively on Vodacom’s network. Vodacom’s eSIM service is called OneNumber and allows customers to use the same number as on their smartphones which use a physical SIM. To use OneNumber, subscribers must link their device to Vodacom and pay R25 per month for the eSIM service. Customers who do not have a Vodacom contract can apply for one at iStore. The operator also offers the service to owners of Samsung’s latest Galaxy Watch series with LTE capability. Vodacom told MyBroadband that the Watch Series 5 with cellular will be available to use with an eSIM from 9 April. “All other details including pricing will be shared closer to launch date,” it added. The GPS-only version of the 40mm Series 5 currently retails for R7,999, while the 44mm version is priced at R8,799.
