Microsoft has revealed detailed specifications of the hardware inside its next-generation console – the Xbox Series X. The console is scheduled to be released in the 2020 holiday season – in either November or December. Microsoft stated that the Xbox Series X will “set a new bar for performance, speed and compatibility, all while allowing you to bring your gaming legacy forward with you and play thousands of games from four generations”. The Xbox Series X will be powered by a custom eight-core AMD Zen2 processor running at a peak frequency of 3.8GHz. When hyper-threading is enabled, the clock will run at 3.66GHz. Microsoft emphasised that these frequencies will be locked, no matter the thermal load. Microsoft claims that this processing power will provide four-times the overall performance of the Xbox One X. The processor will be paired with 16GB of GDDR6 RAM, with a 320MB bus. The custom RDNA 2-class GPU boasts double the graphics performance of the Xbox One X. It will deliver 12 teraflops of computing performance through 3,328 shaders across 52 compute units while running at a sustained 1,825MHz in all environments. This will make it capable of running 4K visuals at a minimum of 60 frames per second, with a 120FPS target frame rate. For reference, tests show it can run an optimised version of Gears 5 on Ultra settings at over 100FPS. Microsoft said one of the other noticeable graphics improvements will be hardware-accelerated DirectX Raytracing, which simulates the natural properties of light and sound in real-time “more accurately than any technology before it”. The console will ship with a 1TB custom NVMe SSD, with the option to expand this with another 1TB via an expansion card. For external storage connectivity, it supports the USB 3.2 standard and comes with a 4K UHD Blu-Ray drive. The console will be backwards compatible with all previous generations of Xbox titles.
