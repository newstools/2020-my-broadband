Dialdirect Insurance’s claim data revealed that there has been a spike in vehicle theft in South Africa in recent weeks. Dialdirect spokesperson Bianca De Beer said the spike follows a festive season lull indicating that criminals took a break over the holidays. “Now that 2020 is in full swing, criminals are back in force and we urge our customers to remain vigilant,” said De Beer. The data revealed that the majority of the vehicle thefts took place during the week and occurred between 12:00 and 18:00. Vehicles are typically targeted while parked on the street, unoccupied. Two or more suspects usually scan the area for possible targets. Once they have chosen their mark, the suspects will park their own vehicle near or next to their mark. To remain inconspicuous, the criminals act like they are working on their vehicle or waiting for someone. Dialdirect said there are many things which people can do to prevent becoming a victim.
