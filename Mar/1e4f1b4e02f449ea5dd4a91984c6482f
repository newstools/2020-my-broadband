Selected Pick n Pay stores are offering a drive-thru service where shoppers do not have to leave their vehicle to buy groceries. This forms part of Pick n Pay’s strategy to better serve their clients during the 21-day coronavirus lockdown in South Africa. Pick n Pay informed customers that their stores will remain open throughout the shutdown, and there is no need to stockpile. “There is enough food in the supply chain, and we ask customers to support us by not stocking up beyond what they need,” the company said. “Our stores will remain open, safe, and well-stocked for our customers during this time so that they can continue to get what they want and need,” said Pick n Pay’s Marketing Head John Bradshaw. “Our staff are working really hard to keep our stores clean and our shelves stocked. We are giving them every support, and ask all our customers to do the same.” For those who would prefer to avoid as much physical interaction as possible with other shoppers and staff, Pick n Pay is offering a drive-thru service. Here is how the Pick n Pay drive-thru service works: Pick n Pay highlighted that it has limited purchases on specific products per customer in store and online to help serve all customers. It should be noted that only a few franchise Pick n Pay stores will offer the drive-thru service to their clients. It will therefore not be available at all stores. <img class="aligncenter wp-image-344573" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Pick-n-Pay-Drive-Thru.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="914" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Pick-n-Pay-Drive-Thru.jpg 672w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Pick-n-Pay-Drive-Thru-280x400.jpg 280w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Pick-n-Pay-Drive-Thru-301x430.jpg 301w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" />
