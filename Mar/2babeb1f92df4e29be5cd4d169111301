Technology companies are known to offer cool perks to their employees to keep them happy. Salesforce offers its employees Volunteer Time Off (VTO), which allows employees to take seven days of paid leave to give back to causes they care about and matches up to $5,000 in spending towards this cause. Tesla has a free shuttle service and a monthly subsidy to help employees manage the costs of travelling to and from work. IBM offers its employees free one-on-one financial sessions with independent consultants to help them manage their personal finances. South African tech companies also offer their employees some great perks – as detailed below. Vodacom offers employees two days of leave each calendar year to participate in volunteer activities. It also offers 24 weeks fully-paid maternity leave, or 16 weeks and the option to work 30 hours per week for the first six months upon their return to work. 10 days of paternity leave is also offered. However, this is set to increase substantially next year. “By 31 March 2021, in line with Vodafone global policy, Vodacom employees will be offered 16 weeks of fully paid parental leave following the introduction of a new global policy designed to support families by giving every parent the opportunity to have more time with children new to their family,” Vodacom told MyBroadband. “Any employee whose partner is having a baby, adopts a child, or becomes a parent through surrogacy will have the flexibility to take up to 16 weeks paid leave at any time during the first 18 months.” Vodacom employees also have access to on-site medical services, hairdressers, beauticians, personal trainers, and a subsidised canteen facility. Finally, Vodacom employees who are the victim of domestic violence or abuse get 10 days fully-paid leave and are offered access to counselling and life management tools, as well as a support and counselling call centre. <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-232631" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Vodacom-logo-red.jpg" alt="Vodacom logo red" width="640" height="430" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Vodacom-logo-red.jpg 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Vodacom-logo-red-300x202.jpg 300w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Vodacom-logo-red-595x400.jpg 595w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> Beyond standard employee benefits such as medical aid and pension fund, MTN offers a variety of lifestyle benefits. “However, there are guidelines and policies that govern these benefits – for example, some benefits require an employee to first complete a service period of 12 consecutive, uninterrupted months of MTN employment and should be permanently employed,” said MTN. MTN highlighted the following employee benefits: All permanent employees Selected permanent employees (Seniors) <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-281319" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/MTN-3.jpg" alt="MTN Store" width="640" height="430" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/MTN-3.jpg 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/MTN-3-300x202.jpg 300w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/MTN-3-595x400.jpg 595w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> Cell C told MyBroadband that it offers various benefits to its employees.

A collaboration culture is being built daily through this approach to the workspace.” iOCO also highlighted that employees have access to its CEO through an online platform. “We can ask questions, share content, and build relationships regardless of designation in the business,” said iOCO. iOCO said that while it offers other benefits such as great in-house coffee, it believes that its commitment to modern working practices drives real change in the company. <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-321522" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/iOCO-Headline-Image.jpg" alt="iOCO Headline Image" width="640" height="430" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/iOCO-Headline-Image.jpg 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/iOCO-Headline-Image-300x202.jpg 300w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/iOCO-Headline-Image-595x400.jpg 595w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> 1-grid CEO Thomas Vollrath said 1-grid encourages employees to try out different functions so that they find something they enjoy doing. “Not only does this result in a positive experience for the employee, but the company grows significantly thanks to their contributions,” said Vollrath.

It sets targets and celebrates milestones through different activities led by its Happiness Manager. These include soccer, cooking competitions, concerts, festivals, bowling, and sunrise kayak excursions. Pargo is also situated in walking distance from Trafalgar pool, which has a “mostly-empty 50m pool.” It also offers flexible work arrangements and a KPI-driven bonus system. “Some of our employees have been with us since we started Pargo in 2015,” said Pargo co-founder Derk Hoekert. “This of course we love to see and reward. We have introduced a loyalty leave day for every year worked at Pargo. Our employees prefer this to the golden watch.” <img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-332714" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Festive-Click-and-collect-Pargo2019-01-640x430.png" alt="Festive-Click-and-collect-Pargo2019-01" width="640" height="430" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Festive-Click-and-collect-Pargo2019-01.png 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Festive-Click-and-collect-Pargo2019-01-595x400.png 595w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Festive-Click-and-collect-Pargo2019-01-300x202.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" />
