The Department of Cooperative Government and Traditional Affairs (Cogta) has published amendments to South Africaâ€™s lockdown regulations, clarifying a number of key points for businesses and individuals. As BusinessTech reports, one of the biggest changes relates to regulation 11B which states that all businesses must cease operations, except if they are classified as an essential service. This caused confusion and concern among businesses as it effectively prohibited employees from working from home. The latest amendments have confirmed this was simply an oversight and now indicate that South Africans can continue to work remotely from their normal place of residence. Notable amendments include: The changes come after South Africa announced its first coronavirus-related deaths, while total confirmed cases have topped 1,000. The two deaths occurred in the Western Cape, one at a private hospital and the other at a public hospital. Health Minister Zweli Mkhize said more information would follow soon.
