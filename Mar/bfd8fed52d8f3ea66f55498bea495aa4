MultiChoice has launched a new DStv channel called “M-Net Binge – The Home of HBO” to help South Africans get through the 21-day national coronavirus lockdown. “MultiChoice and M-Net have conjured up a must-watch pop-up channel with only the best of the best content from the HBO stable,” MultiChoice said. “M-Net Binge – The Home of HBO, channel 114 on DStv Premium and Compact Plus, showcases full seasons of edgy, award-winning series as well as a selection of riveting documentaries and HBO Original films.” The new channel will launch today at 19:00 and will be available seven days a week between 18:00 and 06:00. “‘Why 12 hours only?’ series aficionados may ask,” MultiChoice said. “Only because of the racy nature of the channel and the age-restricted material, which is not suitable for daytime viewing.” MultiChoice said the weekday schedule for M-Net Binge has been curated to broadcast the same series in the same time slot during the week. These shows include The Newsroom, Band of Brothers, Game of Thrones, The Night Of, and Six Feet Under. M-Net Binge will show documentaries up until 21:00 on Saturdays, after which it will broadcast another episode of Game of Thrones. “Sunday’s schedule belongs to series that have been exclusive to the streaming service Showmax to date – His Dark Materials and Succession,” MultiChoice said. “That’s followed by a superstack (six episodes) of classic Sex & The City, starting at 22:00.” DStv Now recently made a selection of news channels free to help South Africans stay informed about the COVID-19 pandemic. DStv Now is an online streaming service which is bundled with DStv’s satellite broadcasting service, and allows subscribers to watch TV and shows from mobile devices, smart TVs, laptops, and more. The new free channel package is available to all South Africans, however, and not only DStv subscribers. Staying informed about the latest news on the virus is the first step in stopping its spread, said the company. To sign up for DStv Now’s free service, users must navigate to the DStv Now portal, select the option to Sign Up, and fill in their details. <img class="aligncenter wp-image-345017 size-large" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/m-net-binge-640x392.jpg" alt="m-net-binge" width="640" height="392" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/m-net-binge-640x392.jpg 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/m-net-binge-600x367.jpg 600w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/m-net-binge-768x470.jpg 768w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/m-net-binge.jpg 980w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" />
