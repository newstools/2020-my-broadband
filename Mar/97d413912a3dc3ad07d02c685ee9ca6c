Apple has revealed the best Night mode photos taken with its latest generation of iPhones. In January, the company launched a challenge for iPhone 11, iPhone 11 Pro, and iPhone 11 Pro Max users to submit their best images taken during the night. A curated panel of judges chose the six winning photos from thousands of global submissions. Apple improved its iPhone’s Night mode capability in 2019 after Huawei and Google introduced similar functionality in their smartphone cameras. Specialised Night mode photography is now supported across its entire iPhone 11 range. The iPhone 11 comes with a dual-camera setup on the rear, while the iPhone 11 Pro and iPhone 11 Pro Max boast triple-camera systems. The dual-camera comprises a 12MP wide and 12MP ultra-wide lens, while the triple-camera configuration adds a 12MP telephoto lens. Night mode employs the wide sensor with its f/1.8 aperture in conjunction with machine learning and the Neural Engine of the A13 Bionic processor to create clear night photos. The feature is automatically activated when the sensor detects dark shooting conditions. It analyses the scene and determines how many frames are required. It then takes a series of photos for a set amount of time (1 second, 3 seconds, 5 seconds, etc.) at different exposure lengths in order to compile a single image that draws upon as much detail in the scene as possible. Users can also adjust the exposure time manually to optimise their photos. Apple said that the winning pictures will be featured in a gallery on Apple’s website and Instagram accounts, as well as on billboards around the world. Below are the six winning photos from Apple’s Night mode challenge. <img class="aligncenter wp-image-341063" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Apple_Shot-On-iPhone-Challenge-Winners_Konstantin-Chalabov_03032020_big.jpg.medium_2x.jpg" alt="Konstantin Chalabov (Moscow, Russia), iPhone 11 Pro" width="640" height="480" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Apple_Shot-On-iPhone-Challenge-Winners_Konstantin-Chalabov_03032020_big.jpg.medium_2x.jpg 1384w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Apple_Shot-On-iPhone-Challenge-Winners_Konstantin-Chalabov_03032020_big.jpg.medium_2x-533x400.jpg 533w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Apple_Shot-On-iPhone-Challenge-Winners_Konstantin-Chalabov_03032020_big.jpg.medium_2x-573x430.jpg 573w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Apple_Shot-On-iPhone-Challenge-Winners_Konstantin-Chalabov_03032020_big.jpg.medium_2x-768x576.jpg 768w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Apple_Shot-On-iPhone-Challenge-Winners_Konstantin-Chalabov_03032020_big.jpg.medium_2x-1200x900.jpg 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> <img class="aligncenter wp-image-341065" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Apple_Shot-On-iPhone-Challenge-Winners_Andrei-Manuilov_03032020_inline.jpg.medium_2x.jpg" alt="Andrei Manuilov (Moscow, Russia), iPhone 11 Pro Max" width="640" height="854" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Apple_Shot-On-iPhone-Challenge-Winners_Andrei-Manuilov_03032020_inline.jpg.medium_2x.jpg 1152w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Apple_Shot-On-iPhone-Challenge-Winners_Andrei-Manuilov_03032020_inline.jpg.medium_2x-300x400.jpg 300w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Apple_Shot-On-iPhone-Challenge-Winners_Andrei-Manuilov_03032020_inline.jpg.medium_2x-322x430.jpg 322w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Apple_Shot-On-iPhone-Challenge-Winners_Andrei-Manuilov_03032020_inline.jpg.medium_2x-768x1025.jpg 768w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Apple_Shot-On-iPhone-Challenge-Winners_Andrei-Manuilov_03032020_inline.jpg.medium_2x-1151x1536.jpg 1151w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> <img class="aligncenter wp-image-341069" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Apple_Shot-On-iPhone-Challenge-Winners_Mitsun-Soni_03032020_inline.jpg.medium_2x.jpg" alt="Mitsun Soni (Mumbai, Maharashtra, India), iPhone 11 Pro" width="640" height="853" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Apple_Shot-On-iPhone-Challenge-Winners_Mitsun-Soni_03032020_inline.jpg.medium_2x.jpg 1152w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Apple_Shot-On-iPhone-Challenge-Winners_Mitsun-Soni_03032020_inline.jpg.medium_2x-300x400.jpg 300w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Apple_Shot-On-iPhone-Challenge-Winners_Mitsun-Soni_03032020_inline.jpg.medium_2x-323x430.jpg 323w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Apple_Shot-On-iPhone-Challenge-Winners_Mitsun-Soni_03032020_inline.jpg.medium_2x-768x1024.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> <img class="aligncenter wp-image-341071" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Apple_Shot-On-iPhone-Challenge-Winners_Ruben-P-Bescos_03032020_big.jpg.medium_2x.jpg" alt="Rubén P.
