South African Airways (SAA) has announced that it has extended its Change It Up Sale to even more major destinations across the world. The struggling state-owned airline is currently running a sale which offers discounts of up to 20% across numerous flights. “In every business, there comes a time for change,” SAA said. “And at SAA we’re changing and that begins with our Change It Up Sale to give you better fares.” “Fly all-inclusive return to New York, Frankfurt, and London from R8,999, or Blantyre and Nairobi from R6,000.” The airline said its sales have been bolstered by these discounts and the reinstatement of travel insurance consultants services, which provides protection for customers choosing to fly with SAA. “Due to the tremendous response we received last week for our special offers, the sale is back by popular demand and we are extending it during this week,” said SAA Chief Commercial Officer Philip Saunders. The extended sale includes destinations such as New York, London, Washington DC, Perth, Frankfurt, Blantyre, Dar es Salaam, Kinshasa, Harare, Lilongwe, Lagos, Lusaka, Livingstone, Maputo, Mauritius, Nairobi, Victoria Falls, and Windhoek. SAA’s Change It Up discounts will last until 6 March 2020 and are available on the SAA website. South African Airways is currently under business rescue, with its business rescue practitioners (BRPs) recently announcing widespread flight cuts at the state-owned airline. “In line with SAA’s commitment to take urgent action to conserve cash, and create a viable platform for a successful future, key measures need to be implemented now,” the BRPs said. “These measures include targeted changes to the route network, deployment of more fuel-efficient aircraft, optimisation of organisational structures and renegotiation of key contracts with suppliers.” This change resulted in SAA cutting all of its domestic routes – including Durban, East London, and Port Elizabeth – except for Cape Town, which it will continue to serve on a reduced basis. The BRPs said a number of jobs will have to be cut as part of the airline restructuring, but that every effort is being taken to limit the impact of job losses in SAA and its subsidiaries. “It is our intention to restructure the business in a manner that we can retain as many jobs as possible. This will help provide a platform to a viable and sustainable future,” they said. <img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-341123" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/SAA-Change-it-Up-640x430.jpg" alt="SAA Change it Up" width="640" height="430" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/SAA-Change-it-Up.jpg 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/SAA-Change-it-Up-595x400.jpg 595w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/SAA-Change-it-Up-300x202.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" />
