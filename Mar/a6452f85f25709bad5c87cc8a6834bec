RSAWEB’s uncapped fibre-to-the-home (FTTH) packages offer the lowest average price of any ISP on Openserve’s network – the biggest fibre network operator in the country. According to a recent fibre pricing comparison by MyBroadband, RSAWEB boasts the best prices per month on the Openserve network for the following home fibre products: This trend is continued for prices on Vuma’s network, with the best pricing on speeds of 50Mbps, 100Mbps, or 200Mbps. RSAWEB’s ongoing load-shedding promotion adds even further value to its products, providing customers with a solution for staying online even when the power is out. While RSAWEB can’t keep your fridge or lights on, it can ensure that you are able to keep gaming, browsing the web, or streaming your favourite shows and movies during power outages. To keep you online during load-shedding, RSAWEB includes a Mini-UPS (uninterruptible power supply) with its fibre packages. This handy device can power an RSAWEB-provided router and the ONT (Optical Network Terminal) supplied by your network operator for between 4-5 hours – enough time to keep your Internet connection going during load-shedding. The Mini-UPS also works with other 12V devices such as a CCTV camera. In addition to the free UPS, new RSAWEB fibre customers benefit from savings of up to R4,500 on their home fibre installation and connection costs. These regular value-added benefits include: Terms and conditions do apply. Great pricing may be key to your selection of ISP, but another major factor to consider is quality of service. RSAWEB said it also enjoys the highest Google Rating of any South African ISP – 4.4 out of 5 stars. This means that RSAWEB customers can expect to be assisted quickly and professionally.
