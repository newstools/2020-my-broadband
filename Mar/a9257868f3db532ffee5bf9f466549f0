If South African Netflix users were only allowed to subscribe to one entertainment service, the large majority would pick Netflix. This is one of the findings of the Netflix 2020 Survey conducted by MyBroadband. The survey was completed by 1,867 tech-savvy South Africans and provides an excellent overview of the local market. When asked: “If you could only subscribe to one service, which one would you pick?”, over 79% of respondents selected Netflix. The popularity of the Netflix selection was reinforced in the overall results, as 80% of all respondents said they have a Netflix subscription. The graph below details which entertainment services South African Netflix users would sign up to if they were only allowed to pick one. Netflix is in a strong first place, with DStv Premium in second spot. Click on the graph to enlarge it.

It must be noted, however, that DStv Premium users receive Showmax for free. Of the respondents who said they subscribe to Showmax and DStv, almost a third had DStv Premium.
