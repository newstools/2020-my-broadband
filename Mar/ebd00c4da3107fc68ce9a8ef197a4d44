Alviva Holdings has reported its first revenue decline in years during its interim results presentation for the six months ended 31 December 2019. The company saw its share price dive in February after speculation that it had seen a decrease in revenue. Its unreviewed interim results revealed a 4.4% decrease in revenue over the last half of 2019, with core earnings per share down 24.5% to 130.2 cents. Alviva Holdings provides a wide range of ICT products and services. Its subsidiaries include Axis, Datacentrix, Centrafin, Pinnacle, and Solareff. During a presentation at the JSE on Tuesday, CEO Pierre Spies highlighted several issues which led to the revenue decline. “We are extremely disappointed, this is not what we wanted. So please, bear with us,” Spies opened. Alviva’s distribution business was hit hard and posted a revenue decline of 9%. Return on equity for this division was down from 27.1% to 13.9%. Spies told MyBroadband that the biggest cause of the issues were delays experienced due to the implementation of a new Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) system. “A major reason for the tough, telling time is the implementation of a new ERP system that impacted the business. Even though the ERP system was a successful implementation, we underestimated the change control,” Spies said. “There were delays on quoting, delays on delivery, and we’ve lost some traction on some market share which we need to regain,” he explained. Spies added that a swing on Forex led to further losses. “Year-on-year, unfortunately, there’s a swing on Forex. We made a Forex loss of R11 million, compared to the previous year’s R8 million profit, which had an impact of R19 million in this financial period,” Spies said. Spies also named a number of big contracts that Alviva’s subsidiaries had secured. This included Datacentrix scoring a renewed agreement with the Reserve Bank, which was extended for a further three years. Additionally, new agreements with AB Inbev, Anglo, and Afgri were concluded. Sintrex, however, had a tough six months and lost a number of large government contracts. Spies said during the presentation that the global coronavirus outbreak would have an effect on Alviva’s business. The exact scope of these effects remain unclear, however, but Spies reiterated that there is serious uncertainty in the short term. “The ETAs are moving up in certain areas,” Spies stated. “But we are going to see it with HP, we are going to see it with Dell, we see it with our solar business – we can’t get supply from China. Most of the stuff is manufactured in China,” Spies said. “Hopefully there is pent-up demand, and the supply just carries on, and after that, we have a few bumper months.” Alviva was buoyed by positive performance in its other divisions, including financial services and services and solutions. Additionally, a big drive on working capital management resulted in cash generation going up from R130 million to R595 million. “We have actually got a good and strong balance sheet,” Spies said. “Overall, we’ve got a very good business, we’ve got a very good platform. We’ve digitised the business, we’ve got a new ERP system and larger subsidiary access, and the future will hopefully bode well for us.” He said that although revenue in the distribution cluster was down, this went against the trend over previous years. “We feel it is a stumbling block for now – we hope to overcome it. We’ve re-aligned our strategies, implemented new go-to-market strategies, and hope to see the trend continue,” Spies said.
