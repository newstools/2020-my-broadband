A sizeable chunk of tech-savvy South Africans spend between R500 – R1,000 per week on online shopping. This was one of the findings of the 2020 Online Shopping Survey conducted by MyBroadband. 1,010 MyBroadband readers took part in the survey, and the results provide a good overview of the South African online shopping market. Of the respondents, 87% said they shopped online. The respondents who shop online were then asked how many times on average they shop online per week and how much they typically spend. In terms of frequency, the majority – 48% – said they shop online less than once per week on average. 26% of the respondents said they shopped online every week, while 13% of respondents said they typically shopped online twice a week.

People need it,” said Ma. Ma added that he wants African entrepreneurs to be celebrated as “heroes” and supported by their governments.
