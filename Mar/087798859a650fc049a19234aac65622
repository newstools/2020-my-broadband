Microsoft’s March 2020 Patch Tuesday provides updates for 115 vulnerabilities – 26 of which have been flagged as “critical”. 17 of these vulnerabilities are related to browsers and scripting engines – making these updates particularly important for those using Edge or Internet Explorer.

For these reasons, it removed the patch and recommended that users who were suffering issues with the patch uninstall it. “This standalone security update has been removed and will not be re-offered from Windows Update, Windows Server Update Services (WSUS) or Microsoft Update Catalog,” said Microsoft.
