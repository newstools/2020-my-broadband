Eskom has announced it will increase load-shedding to stage 4 from 14:00 today following additional breakdowns. Eskom said Koeberg Unit 1 tripped, and has been disconnected from the grid because of a fault on the turbine side, and confirmed that the nuclear reactor remains safe. “The teams are investigating the root causes of the fault, and will advise of the remedy as soon as it is established,” said Eskom. “The loss of approximately 930MW unit puts further strain on the generation fleet, necessitating an increase in the stage of load-shedding.” Eskom said that its ageing fleet is currently constrained, unpredictable, and vulnerable. “We advise South Africans that the stage of load-shedding may change at short notice should there be any unexpected change in the generation system performance,” said Eskom. “Demand has also risen incrementally since January.” Eskom asked customers to continue to use electricity sparingly and to reduce demand by doing the following: “We urge every South African to co-operate in managing electricity consumption with care to help us minimise load-shedding,” said Eskom. “We thank you for your co-operation and understanding so far.”
