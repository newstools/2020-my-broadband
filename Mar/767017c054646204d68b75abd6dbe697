The survey will only take a minute to complete, and by taking part you stand a chance to win cool prizes. The prizes up for grabs are a Google Chromecast and a 240GB SSD. To enter the prize giveaway, state “Done” in this survey forum thread after you have completed the survey. Standard competition rules apply. The results of the survey will be shared with our readers through a series of articles.
