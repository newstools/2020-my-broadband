Facebook has unveiled a redesign of its Messenger app – which includes a new logo, default chat colour and new chat themes. “The new look reflects a shift to the future of messaging – a more dynamic, fun and integrated way to hang out with your favourite people, on your favourite apps and devices,” the company said in a blog post. Facebook said it would also be adding features like selfie stickers and vanish mode soon, the latter of which will allow users to send private messages that won’t remain in any chat history.
