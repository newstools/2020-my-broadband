Microsoft has launched its Surface Go 2 convertible laptop in South Africa. The laptop will be available to both commercial and consumer customers and will be available from Incredible Connection and Vodacom from 22 October. “We’re excited to expand our Surface family with the addition of Surface Go 2 – our smallest and lightest two-in-one laptop,” said Microsoft SA consumer and channel marketing director Vithesh Reddy. Microsoft said the Surface Go 2 is a great option for both work and play and offers strong battery life – up to 10 hours of typical usage. “Sharing Surface Go 2 with your family is seamless and secure, with parent-managed screen time limits, spending control and content filtering – plus plenty of space for your photos, videos and music,” said Reddy. The Surface Go 2 keeps the same slim design as the original Surface Go but boasts a larger display and more powerful hardware – including an Intel 8th-generation Core m3 processor, up to 8GB RAM, and Wi-Fi 6. “Its compact design and the versatility of a touchscreen and keyboard will appeal to businesses, schools, students, and families,” said Reddy. The Surface Go 2also has a 10.5-inch full HD display and boasts dual Studio Mics and a 5MP front-facing camera – making it a great device for video calling. The Microsoft Surface Go 2 will be priced from R8,999 in South Africa and it is now available from Vodacom and Incredible Connection. Specifications and photos of the Microsoft Surface Go 2 are below.
