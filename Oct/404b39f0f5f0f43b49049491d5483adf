As the main supplier of electricity in South Africa, Eskom is the most important state-owned enterprise and a cornerstone of the country’s economy. Without a stable electricity supply, it is impossible for the economy to grow, create jobs, and alleviate poverty. There is, however, a problem. Years of corruption and mismanagement have gutted the company, which is now saddled with a mountain of debt. Eskom has also lost the ability to provide South Africa with a stable electricity supply, and load-shedding has become part of daily life. So severe are these problems that the government had to intervene on multiple occasions to stem the deterioration at the company. Most of these interventions came to nothing. This has, however, not stopped the government from launching a new turnaround plan and a new “war room” to implement this plan. There are many different groups tasked with fixing Eskom, which include the board, the Department of Public Enterprises, the ministerial technical task team, and the former “war room”. Speaking to Business Day TV, Eskom CEO Andre de Ruyter explained how all of these parts fit together in the company’s operations. De Ruyter said the Political Task Team meets on a fortnightly basis and is a valuable tool to address roadblocks experienced in the turnaround strategy. The issues which are typically addressed include municipal debt and National Energy Regulator of South Africa (NERSA) determinations. The graphic below shows how Eskom operates. <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-370799" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Eskom-SOC.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="427" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Eskom-SOC.jpg 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Eskom-SOC-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" />
