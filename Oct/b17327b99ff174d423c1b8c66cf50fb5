Following the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, businesses are more reliant than ever on high-quality connectivity to operate efficiently. The same is true for individuals, who increasingly regard fast, reliable, high-capacity connectivity as essential because it helps them live their lives in the way they want – particularly with remote working, social networking and online entertainment as the daily norm. Therefore, for competing Internet Service Providers (ISPs), wireless ISPs (WISPs) and mobile network operators (MNOs), a high level of network resilience is a crucial consideration when choosing which capacity provider to work with. To be able to offer end-users maximum service uptime, the fundamental starting point for a connectivity provider is to procure from a provider that is backed by a strong Service Level Agreement and has high levels of diversity built into their own network. One such provider is pan-African capacity wholesaler WIOCC, which has an 11-year track record of investing in building Africa’s hyperscale infrastructure. It recently enhanced its network in South Africa with a multi-million-dollar infrastructure investment and now provides reliable, fast, flexible and easily scalable connectivity solutions over a unique, 16Tbps-ready, Optical Transport Network (OTN)-enabled hyperscale network. As a result, high levels of diversity are being delivered over a unique network architecture that includes: “Our approach to redundancy is simple and highly-effective. Instead of having a primary route, with secondary and tertiary back-ups, we make use of a combination of ring topologies that allow us to offer clients up to four routes to reach their desired destinations,” explained WIOCC Sales Manager for Southern Africa, Carlos De Almeida For example, along the very popular Johannesburg to Cape Town route, WIOCC’s commitment to maximising service uptime for clients means it has multiple routes along which it can transport services: Similarly, for clients with customers or operations in neighbouring countries, WIOCC is able to offer diverse cross-border routes – into Botswana, for example, via Ramatlabama and Lobatse. <img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-372378" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/WIOCC-Network-640x430.jpg" alt="WIOCC Network" width="640" height="430" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/WIOCC-Network-640x430.jpg 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/WIOCC-Network-595x400.jpg 595w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/WIOCC-Network-300x202.jpg 300w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/WIOCC-Network-768x516.jpg 768w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/WIOCC-Network.jpg 1159w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> Cost-effective, long-term relationships between capacity providers and purchasers are built upon close working relationships and the ability to deliver customised connectivity solutions that precisely meet each client’s current and projected future needs.
