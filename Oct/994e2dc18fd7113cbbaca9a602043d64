Nvidia has unveiled its new high-powered Ampere-based GPUs for enterprise workloads on desktops and in data centres. The Nvidia RTX A6000 and Nvidia A40 GPUs are succeeding the company’s current Quadro RTX 8000 and 6000 cards. “Built on the NVIDIA Ampere architecture, the GPUs feature new RT Cores, Tensor Cores, and CUDA cores that accelerate graphics, rendering, compute and AI significantly faster than previous generations,” Nvidia stated. The GPUs are intended for use in high-demand applications outside of gaming or mainstream design and video rendering. Nvidia explained among their use-cases, the A6000 and A40 will enable engineers to develop innovative products, designers to create state-of-the-art buildings, and scientists to discover breakthroughs from anywhere in the world. Nvidia did not reveal exact specifications like clock speeds, but claimed the following improvements in hardware and features: Examples of several early adopters of the RTX A6000 GPU named by Nvidia include: Nvidia noted the RTX A6000 will be available from channel partners including PNY, Leadtek, Ingram Micro, Ryoyo, and on nvidia.com starting in mid-December. A6000-based workstations are expected to be released by leading system manufacturers, including Boxx, Dell, HP and Lenovo, at the start of 2021. A40-based servers will be forthcoming from Cisco, Dell, Fujitsu, Hewlett Packard Enterprise and Lenovo around the same date.
