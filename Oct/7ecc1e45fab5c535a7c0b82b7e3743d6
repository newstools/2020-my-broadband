DStv continues to be the dominant pay-TV service in South Africa and offers a variety of packages – each of which has a different content catalogue and price. DStv Premium is the most expensive and comprehensive package, offering a full range of 157 channels. At R819 per month, however, DStv Premium is simply too expensive for many South Africans to justify signing up for. A number of more affordable packages are available, however, each of which balances its price with the content it offers. A full breakdown of the pricing of each DStv package is below: Choosing the right DStv package can be a challenge, as it is difficult to compare the value of each offer. Customers should decide which channels they want to watch and find a package that fulfils this need. For this reason, we have compared the list of channels available on each package. It is worth noting that all packages offer access to all of DStv’s audio channels, with the exception of the DStv Indian package, which has a limited number of audio channels.
