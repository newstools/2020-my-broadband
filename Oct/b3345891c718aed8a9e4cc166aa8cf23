There are a number of tablets available in South Africa which offer powerful components capable of supporting demanding applications and workloads. For most tablet buyers in South Africa, high performance is not necessarily at the top of the list of criteria. Many parents simply want a device which can keep their kids entertained or run educational applications. Other are just looking for a larger display to consume content while on the go. Manufacturers are well aware of these needs, which is why the market offers many low- to mid-end options coming in at under R5,000. This includes several models in Huawei’s MediaPad range, as well as Samsung’s Galaxy Tab A devices. However, given the right combination of hardware and software, a tablet can also serve the more demanding requirements of professionals and creatives. Premium tablets on offer from companies like Apple, Samsung, and Microsoft have the capability to run more intensive applications with laptop-like performance. These tablets often come with the option to connect a keyboard cover for faster typing, or support use with a stylus, allowing for easier navigation, note-taking, and design work. Their compact form-factor and lightweight design make for the perfect companion when working on the go. We listed a number of the most highly-rated premium tablets on offer in South Africa. <img class="aligncenter wp-image-370479 size-large"
