Microsoft has unveiled a range of new peripherals and accessories alongside the launch of its Surface Laptop Go and upgraded Surface Pro X. The line-up includes five new devices – a keyboard, number pad, display adapter, and two mouses. Microsoft said these new accessories are ideal for refreshing new work and school spaces, with many people now shifting their offices and places of learning to the home. The Microsoft Designer Compact Keyboard features a slim and narrow form-factor with Bluetooth connectivity that allows the user to connect and switch between up to three devices. Microsoft claims a set of four coin batteries will provide the keyboard with two years of battery life. For those who need to be able to crunch numbers quickly, Microsoft also offers a Bluetooth number pad. The keyboard and number pad are available in black and white, with respective price tags of $69.99 and $29.99.
