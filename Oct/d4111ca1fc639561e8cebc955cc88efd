Huawei has launched its new Mate 40 Series smartphones at a global launch event on Thursday 22 October. The new lineup comprises the Huawei Mate 40, Mate 40 Pro, and Mate 40 Pro+ – all of which boast 5G connectivity and flagship features. Each of these new devices sports an impressive camera system and is powered by a 5nm Kirin 9000 chipset with built-in 5G modem. Huawei also launched a limited-edition Mate 40 RS Porsche Design device, which sports a similar configuration to the Mate 40 Pro+ but has a unique and striking design. The company said its new Mate 40 Series smartphones will be priced as follows: There is currently no launch date or South African pricing available for these new smartphones. Each of the new Huawei devices is detailed further below. The Huawei Mate 40, like each of the smartphones in the range, sports the new Space Ring camera system. This system comprises three lenses on the back of the device, including a 50MP Ultra Vision camera and support for photo resolutions of up to 8,192 x 6,144. The Huawei Mate 40 has a 6.5-inch OLED display with a refresh rate of 90Hz, as well as a 240Hz touch sampling rate and an in-screen fingerprint sensor. This smartphone will ship with 8GB of RAM and 256GB of internal storage, expandable via NanoSD. It is available in Mystic Silver, White, Black, Green, and Yellow. Huawei’s Mate 40 Pro boasts the same features to the standard Mate 40, along with a few improvements. The most apparent of these is its larger display at 6.76 inches, which retains the high refresh rate and touch sampling rate of the Mate 40. It is also powered by a Huawei Kirin 9000 chipset, which is more powerful than the Kirin 9000e chip used in the Mate 40. The secondary and tertiary lenses on its Space Ring camera system are also improved over the Mate 40, and it has a 13MP front-facing camera which is paired with a 3D depth-sensing camera. The Huawei Mate 40 Pro is available in Mystic Silver, White, Black, Green, and Yellow. The Huawei Mate 40 Pro+ is the most impressive of all three Mate 40 Pro smartphones. It has the same 6.76-inch OLED display with 90Hz refresh rate as the Mate 40 Pro, but it is equipped with an impressive 12GB of RAM and 256GB of internal storage. The Space Ring camera system is also augmented with a fourth lens – an 8MP SuperZoom camera – as well as a depth sensor with autofocus support. Like the Huawei Mate 40 Pro, it is powered by the HiSilicon Kirin 9000 5G chipset and has a large 4,400mAh battery that delivers all-day battery life. The Huawei Mate 40 Pro+ is available in Ceramic White and Ceramic Black. The full specifications of the three new smartphones are shown below. <img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-372484" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Huawei-Mate-40-1-640x430.jpg" alt="Huawei Mate 40 1" width="640" height="430" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Huawei-Mate-40-1.jpg 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Huawei-Mate-40-1-595x400.jpg 595w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Huawei-Mate-40-1-300x202.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> <img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-372494" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Huawei-Mate-40-2-640x430.jpg" alt="Huawei Mate 40" width="640" height="430" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Huawei-Mate-40-2.jpg 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Huawei-Mate-40-2-595x400.jpg 595w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Huawei-Mate-40-2-300x202.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> <img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-372488" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Huawei-mate-40-Pro-640x430.jpg" alt="Huawei mate 40 Pro" width="640" height="430" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Huawei-mate-40-Pro.jpg 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Huawei-mate-40-Pro-595x400.jpg 595w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Huawei-mate-40-Pro-300x202.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> <img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-372486" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Huawei-mate-40-Pro-1-640x430.jpg" alt="Huawei mate 40 Pro 1" width="640" height="430" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Huawei-mate-40-Pro-1.jpg 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Huawei-mate-40-Pro-1-595x400.jpg 595w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Huawei-mate-40-Pro-1-300x202.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> <img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-372492" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Huawei-mate-40-Pro-2-640x430.jpg" alt="Huawei mate 40 Pro+" width="640" height="430" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Huawei-mate-40-Pro-2.jpg 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Huawei-mate-40-Pro-2-595x400.jpg 595w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Huawei-mate-40-Pro-2-300x202.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> <img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-372490" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Huawei-mate-40-Pro-1-1-640x430.jpg" alt="Huawei mate 40 Pro+ 1" width="640" height="430" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Huawei-mate-40-Pro-1-1.jpg 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Huawei-mate-40-Pro-1-1-595x400.jpg 595w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Huawei-mate-40-Pro-1-1-300x202.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" />
