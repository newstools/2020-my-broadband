LG has announced pricing and launch dates for its unconventional LG Wing smartphone in South Africa. The Wing sports a unique swivelling dual-screen setup that supports a number of configurations. In its Basic Mode, the smartphone functions normally, with a single display on the front, a front-facing pop-up camera, and a rear-facing camera on the back. In Swivel Mode, however, the entire front display can be turned 90 degrees, exposing a second smaller screen below it. This allows the user to expand a single application to both screens when or two applications can be displayed simultaneously – one on each display. The smartphone packs a Snapdragon 765G chip with 5G network connectivity, paired with 8GB RAM and 128GB or 256GB storage. Its main screen comprises a 6.8-inch P-OLED display with 1,080 x 2,460 resolution, while the secondary 3.9-inch display comes with a G-OLED panel measuring 1,080 x 1,240 pixels. The second screen can also act as a grip, with the Grip Lock feature allowing it to ignore accidental touches. The LG Wing boasts three rear cameras – a 64MP wide lens, 13MP ultrawide, and 12MP gimbal motion camera. On the front, users get a 32MP pop-up selfie camera. The LG Wing 5G is priced at R19,999 for the 128GB model. It will be available from MTN on 1 November, followed by Vodacom on 7 November, and Cell C in mid-November. Pre-orders for the smartphone can also be placed on the Cellucity website.
