The latest update for WhatsApp’s web client points to the imminent launch of video and voice calling for the web-based version of the messaging platform. According to a report by WABetaInfo, the latest update for WhatsApp Web (version 2.2043.7) includes the ability to make video and voice calls. This feature is currently listed as in the beta stage of development, and the icons within the chat interface indicate that the company is still working on this functionality before it officially launches it. The report stated that the ability to make voice and video calls from WhatsApp Web is expected to roll out in the next few weeks. It added that when a user receives a call using WhatsApp Web, a window will be presented where the user can accept or decline the incoming call. Additionally, when users place a call, a smaller window will pop up that shows the status of the WhatsApp call. Support for group voice and group video calls will also be rolled out to WhatsApp Web, the report stated. WhatsApp is also working on bringing new features to its Android mobile app – specifically, the ability to contact support staff through the application itself. Previously, customers were required to send an email to WhatsApp’s support centre to report a bug or resolve a problem with their messaging app. The new in-app support tool will be available from the Contact Us menu in the Android application and will allow users to send messages to the WhatsApp support team. Text messages, media, and status updates are not included in the logs sent to WhatsApp support staff. This feature remains under development and is not yet available to the public.
