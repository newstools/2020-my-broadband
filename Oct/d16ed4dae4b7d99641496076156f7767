The VR headset is priced at $299 and has been listed for pre-order since last month. “It’s been less than a month since we announced Oculus Quest 2 and opened pre-orders, and we’ve been blown away by the community’s response,” Oculus said in a blog post. “Smaller and lighter than the original Quest, Quest 2 delivers faster performance and our highest-resolution display ever—and it starts at just $299.” The Oculus Quest 2 can be used with a smartphone or PC and includes access to a large library of titles, from Vader Immortal and Beat Saber Multiplayer to Stormland and Medal of Honor: Above and Beyond. It is powered by the Qualcomm Snapdragon XR2 platform with 6GB of RAM, and it offers a display resolution of 1,823 x 1,920 pixels per eye at a 90Hz refresh rate. The Oculus Quest 2 is 10% slimmer than the previous iteration and is compatible with a number of accessories, including the following: Oculus will bundle two new Touch controllers with its Quest 2 VR headset, which offer improved battery life and more efficient tracking. The Oculus Quest 2 VR headset and accessories are available to purchase from the Oculus store.
