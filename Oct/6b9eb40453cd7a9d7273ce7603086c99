It should be noted that only websites which are part of the IAB South Africa and run Narratiive code are included in this comparison. This means that other large websites like the banks, Takealot, and Bidorbuy are not listed. The table below lists the readership figures for South Africa’s largest online publications, based on the September 2020 Narratiive report. South African online news publications were on the forefront of covering the COVID-19 pandemic and subsequent lockdown. This clearly showed in the readership figures as South Africans flocked to online publications for the latest developments. There was a big spike in traffic for most publications during the lockdown, which peaked in June and remains at very high levels. The monthly readership figures for South Africa’s top business publications provide a good overview of this trend. BusinessTech more than doubled its usual readership during the lockdown, while Business Insider, Business Live, and Moneyweb showed equally strong performances. The chart below shows how the readership of the country’s top online business publications spiked during the lockdown. <img class="aligncenter wp-image-370313 size-large" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Business-websites-640x257.jpg" alt="Business-websites" width="640" height="257" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Business-websites-640x257.jpg 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Business-websites-600x241.jpg 600w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Business-websites-768x309.jpg 768w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Business-websites-1536x617.jpg 1536w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Business-websites-1200x482.jpg 1200w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Business-websites.jpg 1847w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" />
