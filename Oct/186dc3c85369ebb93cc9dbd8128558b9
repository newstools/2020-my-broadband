In a time where so much information is stored digitally, paper-based ink signing of documents is no longer a logical solution for businesses. Companies need to be able to enter into and conclude transactions, maintain electronic records, and meet regulatory record-keeping requirements by using digital signing solutions. Electronic signatures greatly improve the speed of sending important documents and ensure that businesses aren’t held up by complicated paper processes. An electronic signature is also a legally-recognised means of conveying the signatory’s consent to the contents of a document – and is intended by the user to serve as a signature. A myriad of industries are increasingly using electronic signatures, including human resources professionals, standard legal firms, specialist commercial law practices, healthcare companies, and financial service providers. By using digital signatures, these businesses gain critical competitive advantages.

Furthermore, it increases control and trust over internal and external processes to decrease compliance-related risks, helping your business navigate country and industry-specific laws and regulations.
