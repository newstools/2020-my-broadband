FNB customers will no longer be able to spend or earn eBucks at Makro, according to a notification on the company’s eBucks Rewards portal. When customers visit the eBucks Rewards page, they are presented with a pop-up notification informing them of the change to the system. “eBucks Rewards and Makro have taken a mutual decision to end their partnership as of 31st October 2020,” the notification said. “From the 1st November 2020, you will not be able to earn or spend eBucks at Makro.” Previously, qualifying FNB customers were able to earn and spend eBucks at Makro stores around the country, providing them with rewards points which they could use to set against purchases or buy entire products outright. FNB customers could earn 0.75% back on each purchase at Makro, and make purchases using eBucks either in-store or online. Earlier this year, FNB announced a number of changes to its eBucks Rewards programme, which include the ability for customers to earn points from their Netflix and Spotify accounts. FNB customers can also earn points to move up a reward level when they use their cards on streaming services such as Netflix and Spotify. Other eBucks rule changes were as follows: The bank said at the time that its eBucks programme had been very successful, with customers earning in excess of R2.4 billion in eBucks over the past year.
