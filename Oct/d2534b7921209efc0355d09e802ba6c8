Rain has launched a new unlimited 4G data package for mobile phones priced at R379 per month on a month-to-month contract. The service offers unlimited data, but with restrictions on the streaming resolution and the ability to use your phone as a hotspot. This new unlimited “4G for phones” service complements Rain’s existing 19-hours unlimited off-peak service for R250 per month. The unlimited off-peak service does not have any restrictions on streaming or being used as a hotspot, but data is charged at R50 per GB between 18:00 and 23:00. This service can also be used in any device, while the new “4G for phones” service can only be used in smartphones. The table below provides an overview of Rain’s current 4G products.
