When it comes to rugged smartphones, Doogee leads the way. This popular international brand is sold exclusively by Cash Crusaders and comes with amazing features. Doogee smartphones boast an IP68 military-standard rating for toughness and durability and use industry-leading high-strength rubber materials that are waterproof, dust-proof and drop-proof. This rubber is usually made for off-road vehicle tyres and has many rigid layers and a silicone lining for excellent shock absorption. This means Doogee smartphones won’t get damaged if dropped and can withstand extreme temperatures, making them ideal for anything from ski trips to safaris. Two standout Doogee devices which are built to these high standards are the S58 Pro and the S88 Pro. The Doogee S58 Pro has a futuristic look and features that make it reliable even in extreme temperatures. It can be submerged in 1m of water for up to 24 hours or 1.5m for 2 hours, which makes it perfect for taking underwater photos or videos. The Doogee S58 Pro also has a dedicated one-press button, giving users quick access to 7 customised shortcuts. These include SOS, flashlight, sound recording, screenshots, underwater camera, panoramic camera, and navigation. The smartphone features four satellite navigation systems for more precise positioning, too, ensuring that users will never get lost. Priced at only R3,499, it is hard to find better value-for-money in a rugged smartphone. <img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-372344" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Doogee-S58-Smartphone-640x430.jpg" alt="Doogee S58 Smartphone" width="640" height="430" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Doogee-S58-Smartphone-640x430.jpg 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Doogee-S58-Smartphone-595x400.jpg 595w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Doogee-S58-Smartphone-300x202.jpg 300w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Doogee-S58-Smartphone.jpg 744w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> The Doogee S88 Pro is unmatched in terms of its battery life. Its 10,000mAh battery is more than twice the size of those most other smartphones use and ensures you will easily get through at least 3 days between charges. Alternatively, you can stream video on the device for 25 hours straight before you will need to charge your S88 Pro again. The Doogee S88 Pro is therefore ideal for camping and will keep you online in situations when you forget to bring your charger along for the journey. The smartphone also supports 5W reverse wireless charging for other devices – meaning it can double as a power bank in emergency situations. As is the case with the S58, the S88 is built for tough conditions and can last a whole day in 1m of water, and can handle high pressure water sprays, temperature extremes, and high humidity. Best of all, it comes at an incredibly good price for a rugged phone of this quality – only R5,299, exclusively available from Cash Crusaders. <img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-372348" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/doogee-s88-pro-640x430.png" alt="doogee s88 pro" width="640" height="430" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/doogee-s88-pro-640x430.png 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/doogee-s88-pro-595x400.png 595w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/doogee-s88-pro-300x202.png 300w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/doogee-s88-pro-768x516.png 768w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/doogee-s88-pro-1536x1032.png 1536w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/doogee-s88-pro-1200x806.png 1200w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/doogee-s88-pro.png 1786w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> Click here to view the Doogee rugged smartphones available from Cash Crusaders.
