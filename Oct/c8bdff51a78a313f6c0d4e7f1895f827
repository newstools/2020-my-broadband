On 16 September 2020, President Cyril Ramaphosa announced that South Africa will move to lockdown alert level 1 from midnight on Sunday 20 September 2020. He said South Africa’s economy and our society have suffered great devastation, and that the move to level 1 will return the economy to a situation that is more normal. In his previous speeches, Ramaphosa encouraged people to stay at home if they can and, if possible, to work from home. This time around the President did not mention working from home, which gives an indication that it is not a top priority any longer. Most large technology and telecommunications companies have previously asked their employees to work from home. In many cases, the lockdown and economic slowdown also forced companies to cut salaries and put staff on short time. To find out whether the move to lockdown level 1 changed the way companies operate, MyBroadband asked the country’s top ICT players for feedback. It emerged that most employees continue to work from home and that salary cuts and short time are not commonplace. There are, however, a few companies which are now giving their staff the option to come into the office should they prefer. There are also some companies which are preparing for rotational office work to start the process to return. Here is a summary of the feedback from South Africa’s top IT and telecoms companies regarding working from home and moving to lockdown level 1. The table below provides an overview of working from home, salary cuts, and short time at South Africa’s biggest tech companies.
