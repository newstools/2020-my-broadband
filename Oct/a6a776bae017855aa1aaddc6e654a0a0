MultiChoice has announced an open weekend for SuperSport content through the DStv app. Customers subscribed to the DStv Compact Plus, Compact, Family, and Access packages will be able to view all SuperSport channels through the DStv app (formerly known as DStv Now) on Saturday 24 October and Sunday 25 October. Normally, most of these SuperSport channels are exclusively available on the DStv Premium bouquet. “During the nationwide lockdown, DStv opened its Premium-exclusive content to a wider pool of its customers through Open Window viewing periods,” MultiChoice said. “Now, this open window comes as soccer fans ready for the kick-off of the DStv Premiership on Saturday 24 October 2020.” DStv was recently announced as the title sponsor for the Premier Soccer League in a five-year deal, and MultiChoice said it will open the full spectrum of SuperSport channels to all customers to celebrate the start of the new season. “Although many eyes will be on soccer, the additional access means that more customers will also experience an incredible line-up of other sports including Vodacom SuperRugby Unlocked, New Zealand’s Mitre 10 Cup, PGA and LPGA golf, Formula 1 and the Giro d’Italia,” the company said. <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-372116" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/DStv-Open-Weekend.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="430" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/DStv-Open-Weekend.jpg 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/DStv-Open-Weekend-595x400.jpg 595w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/DStv-Open-Weekend-300x202.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> To take advantage of the open weekend, you can open the DStv app on your device, log in, and watch any of SuperSport’s 24-hour channels live. If you do not have the DStv app, you can download it from the Google Play Store or Apple App Store. “Please note we have renamed DStv Now to simply DStv,” MultiChoice said. “If your app hasn’t auto-updated on your device, please visit your preferred app store to update your app and ensure that you have the latest version for the best streaming experience.” Below is a selection of the sport available on DStv’s SuperSport open weekend: The company said its new DStv app provides various benefits, which are shown in the infographic below. <img class="aligncenter wp-image-372114" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/DStv-app-infographic.jpg" alt="DStv app infographic" width="640" height="905" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/DStv-app-infographic.jpg 1240w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/DStv-app-infographic-283x400.jpg 283w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/DStv-app-infographic-304x430.jpg 304w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/DStv-app-infographic-768x1086.jpg 768w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/DStv-app-infographic-1086x1536.jpg 1086w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/DStv-app-infographic-1200x1697.jpg 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" />
