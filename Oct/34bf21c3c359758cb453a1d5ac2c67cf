South Africa is often left out of the release plans of other companies, and Google, Amazon, and Tesla are among the businesses that don’t sell their products locally. If you are really eager to get your hands on one of these devices, you have two options: Note that the prices listed on US websites are subject to additional import taxes, VAT, and shipping fees. The world’s biggest ecommerce retailer – Amazon – offers a shipping calculator that takes all costs into account if a product is eligible for delivery to South Africa. Its calculation includes the following: This means you will pay the full amount upfront and will not get any nasty surprises when the product needs to be moved through customs. For most of the products noted above, you will have to use a paid-for parcel-forwarding service such as MyUS. This provides you with a foreign address to which your package is first delivered. From there, it is transported and shipped to South Africa. The additional MyUS fee will be determined by the weight of the package, starting at $24.99 (R416) for items weighing less than 1lb (540g). Customs fees and taxes will then have to be paid directly to the courier. Choosing to import also carries the risk of having to ship the item back to the country of origin for repair or replacement at your own cost in the event that it is faulty. An alternative option is to use retailers like Geewiz and Connected Devices, which specialise in importing gadgets and smartphones that are not officially available in the country. These companies offer various warranties on their imported stock, which means you won’t be hung out to dry if your device malfunctions. The tables below show how much it would cost to import some of the most popular devices you cannot buy locally. Calculations when using a package-forwarding service were not included in this comparison. We have provided more information on these products below the import costs below. Ecommerce giant Amazon offers a range of smart home and security devices with Alexa integration in its respective Echo and Ring ranges.

When plugged into a TV’s HDMI port, the Chromecast is able to receive streamed content from a nearby PC or mobile device connected on the same Wi-Fi network, effectively acting as a smart TV box. The company recently launched a new version of the Chromecast, which includes a Google TV app that aggregates content across streaming platforms to act as a single search and curation engine for movies and shows. The Chromecast with Google TV supports streaming in 4K HDR and also includes a remote, so you won’t have to use your computer or peripherals to navigate the interface. <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-369601" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Chromecast-with-Google-TV.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="430" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Chromecast-with-Google-TV.jpg 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Chromecast-with-Google-TV-595x400.jpg 595w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Chromecast-with-Google-TV-300x202.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> Google’s Nest range includes a wide variety of smart home devices such as speakers Wi-Fi routers, doorbells, thermostats, smart hubs, alarm systems, and security cameras.

These phones have been praised for offering great camera capabilities and solid design in a light and compact form-factor. The latest iteration – the Pixel 5 – was launched at the end of September – and boasts a 6.0-inch 1,080 x 2,340 OLED display, dual-camera, and 5G connectivity. <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-369583" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Google-Pixel-5-2.jpg" alt="Google Pixel 5 2" width="640" height="430" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Google-Pixel-5-2.jpg 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Google-Pixel-5-2-595x400.jpg 595w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Google-Pixel-5-2-300x202.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> Motorola’s original Razr was a massive global hit back when it launched in 2004. While the company’s attempt at a version with a foldable display released early in 2020 has not been as successful as that phone, it still makes for an enticing piece of hardware. The second-generation of this foldable device includes a better processor and 5G connectivity. <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-327589" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Moto-Razr-headline-1.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="430" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Moto-Razr-headline-1.jpg 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Moto-Razr-headline-1-300x202.jpg 300w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Moto-Razr-headline-1-595x400.jpg 595w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> Nvidia’s Shield TV and Shield TV Pro are high-performing smart boxes with advanced streaming features.
