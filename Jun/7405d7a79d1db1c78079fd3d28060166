This is a decrease from the level 4 lockdown that South Africa has been under in recent weeks. Level 3 lockdown means that many more South Africans are able to return to work, and is expected to provide a boost to the struggling economy. Additionally, level 3 lockdown marked the unbanning of alcohol sales. This caused South Africans across the country to flock to their nearest bottle store, resulting in extremely long queues. MyBroadband visited the Makro in Centurion at 08:30 today – 30 minutes before the store was allowed to sell alcohol – and the queues were already snaking through the parking lot. There were between 200-300 people in the queue when we arrived. However, despite the deregulation of alcohol sales, the sale of cigarettes and tobacco products remains prohibited in South Africa.
