ASUS has unveiled three new ZenBook models, which it claims are the world’s thinnest laptops with HDMI and standard USB ports. The 2020 lineup includes updated versions of the ZenBook 13, ZenBook 14, and ZenBook Flip 13. The ZenBook 13 is 13.9mm thick, and weighs only 1.07kg, while the ZenBook 14 is slightly thicker and heavier at 14.3mm and 1.17kg. Despite their compact design, both laptops boast full-size USB Type-A ports, two Thunderbolt 3 USB-C connections, an HDMI port, and a microSD card reader. The ZenBook Flip 13 is a 2-in-1 convertible with a 360-degree hinge that allows it to be used as a conventional laptop or tablet. The Flip 13’s chassis has the same 13.9mm thickness as the ZenBook 13, and it tips the scale at 1.3kg. The ZenBook 13 and 14 sport IPS-level displays with a resolution of 1,920 x 1,080 in a NanoEdge thin-bezel design. This provides a 88% screen-to-body ratio on the ZenBook 13 and 90% on the ZenBook 14. Both laptops can be configured with an Intel 10th-gen Core-i3, Core-i5, or Core-i7 processor, with capacity for up to 32GB RAM and a 2TB SSD. For the 14-inch model, users also have the option of an eight-core AMD Ryzen 7 4700U CPU, paired with up to 16GB RAM and 2TB storage. The ZenBook Flip 13 also sports a Full HD display and can be fitted with either a 10th-gen Core-i5 or Core-i7, paired with up to 16GB RAM and 1TB of NVMe SSD storage. ASUS claims the 67Wh battery in its laptops will provide up to 22 hours of usage for the ZenBook 13 and 14, and 16 hours for the Flip 13. It can also be filled to 60% in 49 minutes with its fast-charging feature. No information on local availability or pricing for the laptops was available at the time of publication. Below are the specifications of the ASUS ZenBook 13, ZenBook 14, and ZenBook 13 Flip. <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-356485" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/ASUS-ZenBook-13_front.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="430" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/ASUS-ZenBook-13_front.jpg 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/ASUS-ZenBook-13_front-595x400.jpg 595w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/ASUS-ZenBook-13_front-300x202.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-356483" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/ASUS-ZenBook-13-back.jpg" alt="ASUS ZenBook 13 back" width="640" height="430" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/ASUS-ZenBook-13-back.jpg 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/ASUS-ZenBook-13-back-595x400.jpg 595w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/ASUS-ZenBook-13-back-300x202.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" />  <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-356481" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/ZenBook-14-front.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="430" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/ZenBook-14-front.jpg 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/ZenBook-14-front-595x400.jpg 595w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/ZenBook-14-front-300x202.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-356487" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/ASUS-ZenBook-14_back.jpg" alt="ASUS ZenBook 14_back" width="640" height="430" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/ASUS-ZenBook-14_back.jpg 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/ASUS-ZenBook-14_back-595x400.jpg 595w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/ASUS-ZenBook-14_back-300x202.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" />
