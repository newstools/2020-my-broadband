The Wireless Application Service Providers’ Association (WASPA) has warned South Africans to be vigilant against SMS scams and other malicious digital activities during the lockdown period. “With 90 million mobile connections and widespread availability of money transfer and digital banking facilities, SA is tremendously attractive to mobile fraudsters,” said WASPA general manager Ilonka Badenhorst. “People feel comfortable within their own homes and may not be as cautious online as we would ordinarily be within a corporate setting.” To this end, WASPA has provided the following SMS-related safety advice to South Africans who are looking to stay safe digitally during the lockdown period. WASPA also suggested the following measures be taken by South Africans to protect themselves from online attackers. “Information is power and never has this been more true than during humanity’s current battle against the coronavirus,” said Badenhorst. “As always, our best weapon online and in the changing bricks and mortar world is our own common sense.”
