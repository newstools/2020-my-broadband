Intel has announced that it will discontinue its 8th-generation Coffee Lake desktop processors. In a Product Change Notification (PCN) document issued on 3 June 2020, Intel stated that its 8th-generation Celeron, Core, and Pentium desktop CPUs would reach end of life this year. According to Intel’s timeline, the processors will no longer be available to order after the last product discontinuance order date, which is slated for 18 December 2020. Market demand for the products … has shifted to other Intel products,” Intel said in the PCN document. “The products identified in this notification will be discontinued and unavailable for additional orders after the ‘Last Product Discontinuance Order Date’.” After 18 December 2020, orders for Intel 8th-generation processors will no longer be able to be cancelled or returned. “At this date, a snapshot will be taken of all remaining backlog and/or assurance and this quantity will become non-cancellable,” Intel said. The full list of discontinued processors is below: Intel’s 8th-generation desktop core processors – codenamed “Coffee Lake” – were launched in October 2017. The processors used the same LGA 1151 CPU socket as previous-generation CPUs. However, they were not compatible with older 100- and 200-series chipsets, only with the 300-series motherboards which launched alongside them. Over the next year, Intel continued to launch 8th-generation desktop processors, with the Intel Core i7-8086K launching on 8 June 2018. This CPU was a limited-edition product built to commemorate the 40th anniversary of the Intel 8086 CPU architecture. These chipsets were replaced by the 9th-generation Cofee Lake refresh processors at the end of 2018.
