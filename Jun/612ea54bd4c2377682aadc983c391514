The lockdown was implemented to curb the spread of the coronavirus in South Africa, and imposes restrictions on personal movement as well as the operations of various businesses around the country. The government has also announced that it will extend the National State of Disaster until 15 July. “After obtaining legal advice and listening to numerous comments made by members of the legal fraternity in reaction to this judgement, we are of the view that another court might come to another conclusion on the matter,” Minister in the Presidency Jackson Mthembu said in a media briefing on 4 June. “Cabinet has therefore decided to appeal the North Gauteng High Court decision.” The government said it will ask that its appeal is heard on an urgent basis so that the country can gain certainty on the regulations. “The Minister of Cooperative Governance and Traditional Affairs Dr Nkosozana Dlamini-Zuma will be joined in this appeal by President Cyril Ramaphosa and Minister of Health Dr Zweli Mkhize,” Mthembu said. “Cabinet wishes to assure the nation that all interventions introduced since the declaration of a State of National Disaster in March 2020 by President Cyril Ramaphosa have been directed primarily at saving lives.”
