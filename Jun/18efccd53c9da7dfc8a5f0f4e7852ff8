With many tablets out there sporting larger screens, it’s hard to find a lightweight yet portable smart device without restricted performance. Huawei has always continued to innovate when it comes to tablets, and now they have released the HUAWEI MatePad T 8, a mid-range Android tablet that does not sacrifice flair or function. Smaller in size yet similarly powerful in performance, it is priced at R2,999 – the HUAWEI MatePad T8 proves to be an all-round choice with a good value for money for families and more. Within its compact size, it packs an octa-core processor where you don’t have to worry about running multiple applications in the background and your tablet lagging. Let’s say you want to show something briefly to a client or your child wants to play a short game, you can still have your important documents running in the background. Aside from a powerful processor, it also packs a large 5,100mAh battery that lets you play 12 hours of local videos continuously and can be used for 3 days on one charge. And if you don’t need to watch videos or use high-power consumption apps, it can last up to 600 hours on standby, which is a lifesaver if you don’t want to keep having to charge your tablet[1]. <img class="aligncenter wp-image-358069 size-large" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Huawei-MatePad-T-640x356.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="356" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Huawei-MatePad-T-640x356.jpg 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Huawei-MatePad-T-600x334.jpg 600w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Huawei-MatePad-T-768x428.jpg 768w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Huawei-MatePad-T-1200x668.jpg 1200w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Huawei-MatePad-T.jpg 1424w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> The 8-inch display is just a little smaller than an A5 sheet of paper.

With a high 80% screen-to-body ratio, no space is wasted giving an immersive visual experience. <img class="aligncenter wp-image-358065 size-large" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Huawei-MatePad-T-2-640x367.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="367" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Huawei-MatePad-T-2-640x367.jpg 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Huawei-MatePad-T-2-600x344.jpg 600w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Huawei-MatePad-T-2-768x441.jpg 768w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Huawei-MatePad-T-2-1200x689.jpg 1200w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Huawei-MatePad-T-2.jpg 1380w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> With smart devices always within our reach, it’s hard to divert attention away from them. Sometimes it can have long-lasting effects on our eyes, such as eye fatigue, myopia, or disrupting our sleep patterns due to the strong blue light emitted. The HUAWEI MatePad T 8 has a number of features attentive to eyecare. To minimise the effect of blue light, you have an option to open the Eye Comfort mode. In Kids Corner, It has several eye protection features like posture alerts. Additionally, the HUAWEI MatePad T 8 supports eBook mode[2]. By adjusting contrast, brightness, clarity, colour saturation and other parameters, this creates an eBook mode that displays content using a paper-like effect, ensuring eye protection while providing a great reading experience all at the same time. <img class="size-large wp-image-358067 aligncenter" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Huawei-MatePad-T-3-640x356.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="356" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Huawei-MatePad-T-3-640x356.jpg 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Huawei-MatePad-T-3-600x334.jpg 600w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Huawei-MatePad-T-3-768x427.jpg 768w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Huawei-MatePad-T-3-1200x667.jpg 1200w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Huawei-MatePad-T-3.jpg 1415w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> Staying at home can take its toll – it’s easy for children to be curious and spend long amounts of time on a tablet, especially with a larger screen fit for gaming.  The HUAWEI MatePad T 8 is catered for children too with the Kids Corner.
