Last night, President Cyril Ramaphosa announced the easing of lockdown regulations which will allow for the reopening of more industries and leisure activities. “When I announced the country would be moving to alert level 3 from the 1st of June, I said we would be giving consideration to reopening other sectors of the economy,” Ramaphosa said. This re-opening would, however, only be allowed if the necessary safety precautions could be put in place and maintained. Following discussions with industry representatives on stringent prevention protocols, cabinet has decided to ease restrictions on the following economic activities: In each instance, specific and stringent safety requirements have been agreed on and will need to be put in place before a business can reopen. Ramaphosa added that protocols will need to be strictly adhered to for businesses to remain open. “Announcements will be made in due course to detail these measures and indicate the date from which these activities will be permitted,” he said. <img class="aligncenter wp-image-356447 size-large" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Allowed-640x321.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="321" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Allowed-640x321.jpg 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Allowed-600x301.jpg 600w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Allowed-768x385.jpg 768w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Allowed.jpg 828w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> While Ramaphosa’s latest announcement opens up most parts of the economy which were still closed, there are still a few restrictions which hold. The sale of tobacco products, including cigarettes and vaping products, remains prohibited under level 3. Social gatherings are still not allowed and where people are allowed to gather, like for workplace meetings and business events, there is still a limit of 50 people. The consumptions of alcohol in restaurants, bars, shebeens, and taverns remain prohibited under the new rules. Gyms and fitness centres also remain closed. Ramaphosa did not mention anything regarding the movement of people, which means travelling between provinces, districts, and metropolitan areas is still restricted. International travel is not allowed, except for very specific purposes for which you need to make arrangements directly with the Department of Home Affairs. Landlords many also still not evict a person from their land or home under level 3. <img class="aligncenter wp-image-356451 size-large" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Prohibited-640x321.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="321" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Prohibited-640x321.jpg 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Prohibited-600x301.jpg 600w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Prohibited-768x385.jpg 768w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Prohibited.jpg 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> The table below provides an overview of the new level 3 lockdown rules in South Africa.
