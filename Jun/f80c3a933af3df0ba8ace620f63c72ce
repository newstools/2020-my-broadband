Microsoft has detailed a number of features coming to its new Chromium-based Edge Internet browser which will greatly improve the experience of reading PDF files in the application.

The Chromium-based version of the Edge Internet browser is now available for users on Windows and Mac, and it is rolling out to Windows 10 users through Windows Update. It is based on the Chromium web engine, which is the same framework that Google Chrome is built on, although Microsoft’s browser includes a number of unique features, such as support for 4K Netflix playback. Microsoft has also recently ramped up its efforts to convert Chrome users to its new Edge browser. The company has added an advertisement for its Edge Internet browser to the Windows 10 start menu which will appear when a Windows 10 user searches their system for an alternative browser, including Google Chrome. It also shows a fullscreen splash page advertising the newly-installed Edge browser after Windows 10 users download the latest update. If Windows 10 users had previously unpinned the Edge browser from their taskbar or uninstalled the browser, they will need to so again after downloading this update.
