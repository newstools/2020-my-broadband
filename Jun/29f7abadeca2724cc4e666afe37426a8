35 812. â€” Dr Zweli Mkhize (@DrZweliMkhize) June 2, 2020  A recent report from Ask Africa has found that out of all ministers and officials involved in the administration of the COVID-19 lockdown, Ramaphosa is the most trusted. The report also showed that there is a high level of distrust in Cooperative Governance and Traditional Affairs (COGTA) Minister Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma. The research found that most people trust the President to lead the country during the lockdown and believe he is taking the lead to manage the country. This sentiment has, however, declined over the past four weeks, and more than 60% of South Africans want to hear from the President at least once a week. Further to this, 78% of people would like to receive frequent communication from Health Minister Zweli Mkhize.
