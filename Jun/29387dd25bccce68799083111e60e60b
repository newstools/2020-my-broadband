This means that when a user has finished reading a Codehesion article on MyBroadband, there is a very high likelihood they will then visit Facebook. When they visit Facebook, they will then be shown the Codehesion advert, reinforcing the brand and the message. Additionally, the reader can be shown the Facebook advert for up to 180 days after reading an article. The Codehesion campaign delivered excellent results in its first week alone. From 21-29 May 2020, Facebook adverts were served to users who had read Codehesion articles published in the previous weeks. Standard Twitter and LinkedIn campaigns were also run for Codehesion targeting MyBroadband readers to provide a base for comparison.
