The legal action bought by the Fair-Trade Independent Tobacco Association (FITA) against the ban is set to be heard on Tuesday and Wednesday. FITA has said that the core issue of the case revolves around whether the banning of the sale of cigarettes is rational. The government argues that smoking could lead to an increase in coronavirus cases and even death, but FITA said this is not an issue that is limited to cigarettes. British American Tobacco South Africa (BATSA) has also commenced urgent legal proceedings to challenge the ban – adding that the government had betrayed its trust after it had originally negotiated on the matter.
