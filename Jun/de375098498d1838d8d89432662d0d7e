As the coronavirus pandemic enters a “new and dangerous phase”, the price of safe haven gold is approaching its highest since 2012 – but one big investment bank thinks the economic response will soon see the yellow metal swell to its highest price ever. With central bank interest rates leading to poor returns from income-paying investments like your bank’s saving account and government bonds, gold’s price is now up 15% this year – sitting just below levels last seen eight years ago. <img class="size-full wp-image-357655 aligncenter" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Revix-Gold-Graph.jpg" alt="" width="572" height="338" /> With Brazil, the USA, and South Africa at the forefront of a record daily increase in coronavirus cases, and more details emerging of China’s confrontational new security law in Hong Kong, investors may be feeling less optimistic about a “V-shaped” global economic recovery. Derivative traders – who bet on the future movement of gold prices – are at their most positive position in a month. And they’re not the only ones. Investment bank Goldman Sachs is predicting gold will hit a record high of $2,000 an ounce within the next 12-months: in other words, gold is set to rise another 15% from its present position. For those sadly lacking a gold bullion vault, Revix, the fintech backed by JSE-listed Sabvest, offers a simple and cost effective way to invest in gold. Through Paxos Gold – a regulated and insured cryptoasset – you can invest in gold with as little as R500 and not have to worry about the custody and insurance burdens of physical ownership. Revix offers a modern and effortless way to own physical gold, that enables you to sell your gold investment whenever you choose – whether that’s in a couple hours or many year’s time. One PAX Gold token is backed by one fine troy ounce of the highest quality gold stored in high-security, fully insured vaults. Gold is a safety net in terms of economic uncertainty and it acts as a hedge against inflation thanks to its limited supply and long trading history. So unlike central banks who are printing money at unprecedented levels, gold’s supply remains steady. This means gold acts as a rand hedge and is widely recommended as part of a diversified portfolio. It’s one of a handful of investments with a positive return in 2020 – gold prices are around $1,780 an ounce and have gained 15% so far in 2020 and 34% over the past 12 months. Sean Sanders, CFA Charterholder and CEO of investment platform Revix added: “The unprecedented printing of money by governments is why it’s critically important today more than ever to hold inflationary hedges like gold in your investment portfolio. “Investments like gold can protect your hard-earned savings at times like these, meaning they will hold their value, or increase in value, rather than lose value like currency does when inflation occurs.” Sanders continues “We’ve seen record customer sign-ups over the last few weeks as many of our new clients realise that with no monthly account fees we can offer them substantially lower costs than elsewhere else. Additionally, South Africans are seeing their hard earned rand savings going up in smoke and want investments that strengthen when the rand weakens.” Revix is also offering customers a remarkable gold investment offer for the last week of June.
