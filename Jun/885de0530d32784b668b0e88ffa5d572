Madhi attributed the recent death of a two-day-old baby to complications from premature birth, despite the baby’s COVID-19-positive classification. Madhi said the cause of death was hyaline membrane disease and the fact that the child tested positive for the coronavirus that causes COVID-19 was purely coincidental. Several other cases have also been questioned. These include a two-year-old baby with serious comorbidities, a teenager who was suffering from a very rare disease, and a teenager who died in a car accident.
