He said that while most countries wait for the number of COVID-19 cases to go down before they ease their lockdown restrictions, South Africa is going in the opposite direction. The country has lifted most lockdown restrictions while the number of coronavirus cases is increasing. One of the big concerns is that the recent opening of schools in South Africa will result in the rapid spread of the virus. Karim dismissed this concern, saying they anticipate going back to school will have minimal effect on the overall COVID-19 transmission. “We expect a few cases in schools which will occur – people will bring it from their homes or wherever they have been to. But we are not expecting it will cause any major concerns,” said Karim. This is in line with recent comments from the World Health Organization’s Dr Maria Van Kerkhove that the asymptomatic spread of coronavirus is rare.
