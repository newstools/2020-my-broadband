With SA businesses across sectors re-entering into a difficult economic environment post lockdown, leaders will arguably have to place more emphasis than ever before on customer-centricity. As we have already seen, the way in which businesses and brands communicate with and respond to customers is a huge determining factor in whether or not that brand can retain customers and ensure continuity of spend. Added to this, customers want to be able to communicate with businesses via multiple platforms, including web chats, WhatsApp, voice calls and video. These moments of contact or communication are pivotal to brand loyalty, and those that get it right will be well-positioned to succeed, as more consumers look for streamlined and engaging digital offerings.
