Acer has announced its new Swift 5 laptop at the Acer Global Conference. According to Acer, the Swift 5 offers a new take on productivity while remaining extremely portable. “The new Swift 5 pushes the envelope on what thin-and-light notebooks can be,” said Acer general manager for notebooks James Lin. “A productivity powerhouse housed in a sleek and ultraportable chassis, the Swift 5 is an excellent option for professionals who are always on the move and seeking a device capable of keeping up with them.” The Acer Swift 5 is a portable laptop, making it easy to carry for users who are constantly on the move. It is made from high-grade magnesium-lithium and magnesium-aluminium that is just 14.95mm thick. With a weight of under 1kg, the Acer Swift 5 is the perfect laptop for the person who is always on the move. The Swift 5 sports a next-generation Intel Core processor and supports up to Nvidia GeForce MX350 graphics. It also offers users up to 1TB of PCIe SSD storage and 16GB of RAM – impressive for a mobile device. The Swift 5’s 14-inch Full HD IPS touchscreen display supports multi-finger gestures and offers up to a 90% screen-to-body ratio. The display sports Antimicrobial Corning Gorilla Glass, which the company said has been designed specially to reduce the growth of odours and stain-causing microorganisms on the glass. The Swift 5 sports a 56Wh battery that the company claims lasts all day and also offers a fast-charge capability which delivers four hours of use from just 30-minutes of charge time. Users also get an embedded fingerprint reader and support for the latest connectivity standards – Wi-Fi 6 and Bluetooth 5. Acer said the Swift 5 will be available in South Africa from November and will be priced from R16,999.
