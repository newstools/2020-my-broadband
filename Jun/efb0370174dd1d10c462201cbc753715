DStv is trying to entice former Premium subscribers back to the service with the promise of live sport returning to the platform next week. Subscribers who have cancelled their DStv Premium subscriptions received the following SMS message from MultiChoice: “DStv: Live sport is back from next week! So don’t waste time. Come back to DStv Premium & reunite with favourites like the PGA on SS1 (CH 201).” MultiChoice confirmed that the SMS was not a scam, but could not comment on the effectiveness of the campaign, as it is currently in a closed period ahead of the announcement of its financial results. Following the SMS messages, SuperSport issued a statement highlighting all the sports that are returning to its channels, including soccer, rugby, cricket, golf, and racing: <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-354793" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/DStv-Premium-live-sport-SMS.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="322" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/DStv-Premium-live-sport-SMS.jpg 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/DStv-Premium-live-sport-SMS-600x302.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" />
