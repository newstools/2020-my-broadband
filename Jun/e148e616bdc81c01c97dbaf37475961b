Shabir Madhi, professor of vaccinology at the University of the Witwatersrand, said the Eastern Cape will be where the Western Cape is now, in two weeks’ time. He said that Gauteng will approach this level in four weeks’ time, and the Western Cape will be three-times worse than it is now in one month. Madhi and others warned there will be a rapid increase in cases if people do not adhere to interventions like social distancing, wearing masks, and washing hands frequently.
