Recent reports have revealed possible details of Nvidia’s next generation of graphics cards – the GeForce RTX 3000 series. According to sources who spoke to German news publication Igor’s Lab, Nvidia’s Ampere-based cards will be headlined by the GeForce RTX 3090. This card will use a 384-bit memory interface, boast 24GB of GDDR6X video memory, and a 350W thermal design power (TDP). This would be a substantial jump from the company’s current most powerful graphics card for gaming – the RTX 2080 Ti – which features 11GB of GDDR6 video memory and a 260W TDP. The memory specifications of the RTX 3080 match that of Nvidia’s current flagship card for enterprises – the TITAN RTX – although its TDP is rated at 70W higher. The RTX 3080 and RTX 3070 reportedly feature 11GB and 10GB of GDDR6X video memory, respectively. The table below shows the specifications of the RTX 3070, RTX 3080, and RTX 3090 as reported by Igor’s Lab. The publication also supported the legitimacy of images posted on the Chiphell Forums which purportedly show the RTX 3080 Founders Edition card. According to Igor Lab’s sources, Nvidia has launched an internal investigation to identify the leaker. The images show two GeForce RTX cards with designs that feature a fan on either side of the card. Another image which supposedly shows the heatsink of the card was posted on Reddit by user LeeJiangLee. It appears to match the design seen in the images on Chiphell. Although no official reveal or launch dates have been announced for the RTX 3000 series, analysts expect Nvidia to unveil the new cards in August for release in September. Below are images from Chiphell Forums user LeeJiangLee which claim to show the RTX 3080 graphics card and its heatsink. <img class="aligncenter wp-image-355771" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/RTX-3080-leaked_Chiphell-Forums_1.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="480" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/RTX-3080-leaked_Chiphell-Forums_1.jpg 1306w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/RTX-3080-leaked_Chiphell-Forums_1-533x400.jpg 533w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/RTX-3080-leaked_Chiphell-Forums_1-573x430.jpg 573w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/RTX-3080-leaked_Chiphell-Forums_1-768x576.jpg 768w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/RTX-3080-leaked_Chiphell-Forums_1-1200x900.jpg 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> <img class="aligncenter wp-image-355773" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/RTX-3080-leaked_Chiphell-Forums_2.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="289" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/RTX-3080-leaked_Chiphell-Forums_2.jpg 2234w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/RTX-3080-leaked_Chiphell-Forums_2-600x271.jpg 600w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/RTX-3080-leaked_Chiphell-Forums_2-640x289.jpg 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/RTX-3080-leaked_Chiphell-Forums_2-768x347.jpg 768w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/RTX-3080-leaked_Chiphell-Forums_2-1536x694.jpg 1536w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/RTX-3080-leaked_Chiphell-Forums_2-2048x925.jpg 2048w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/RTX-3080-leaked_Chiphell-Forums_2-1200x542.jpg 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> <img class="aligncenter wp-image-355775" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/RTX-3080-leaked_Chiphell-Forums_3.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="299" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/RTX-3080-leaked_Chiphell-Forums_3.jpg 2240w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/RTX-3080-leaked_Chiphell-Forums_3-600x281.jpg 600w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/RTX-3080-leaked_Chiphell-Forums_3-640x299.jpg 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/RTX-3080-leaked_Chiphell-Forums_3-768x359.jpg 768w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/RTX-3080-leaked_Chiphell-Forums_3-1536x719.jpg 1536w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/RTX-3080-leaked_Chiphell-Forums_3-2048x958.jpg 2048w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/RTX-3080-leaked_Chiphell-Forums_3-1200x561.jpg 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-355777" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/RTX-3080_Reddit-.png" alt="RTX 3080_Reddit_LeeJiangLee" width="640" height="480" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/RTX-3080_Reddit-.png 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/RTX-3080_Reddit--533x400.png 533w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/RTX-3080_Reddit--573x430.png 573w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" />
