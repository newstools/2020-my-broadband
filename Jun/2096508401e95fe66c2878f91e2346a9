Acer has launched a new suite of premium notebooks, desktops, and monitors to expand its ConceptD premium laptop lineup for creators. The ConceptD 3 Ezel and ConceptD 3 notebooks are both designed for design students, freelance designers, and small design studios. These laptops are capable of handling medium-to-complex CAD work, the company said, and prioritise a great display and powerful graphics to achieve this. The ConceptD is a great desktop for those who do graphics-intensive 2D design or are interested in getting into entry-level 3D CAD modelling. This desktop also pairs well with Acer’s new ConceptD range of designer-focused displays. Acer’s new ConceptD products will be available on the following dates at the following prices: The ConceptD 3 Ezel is a 2-in-1 notebook that comes in both 14-inch and 15.6-inch form factors. It offers 18 hours of battery life and sports a variety of connectivity options including an SD card reader and USB Type-C Thunderbolt 3. The ConceptD 3 Ezel has amber-backlit keys and a large glass trackpad that supports multi-finger gestures. The Ezel hinge allows users to switch between six usage modes – including stand mode for drawing content and display mode for presenting it. Its display covers 100% of the sRGB colour gamut and features 4,096 levels of pressure sensitivity. In terms of performance, it sports up to a 10th-generation Intel Core i7, either Nvidia Quadro T1000 or GeForce GTX 1650Ti graphics, and 1TB of PCIe storage. <img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-357265" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Acer-ConceptD-Ezel-640x430.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="430" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Acer-ConceptD-Ezel.jpg 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Acer-ConceptD-Ezel-595x400.jpg 595w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Acer-ConceptD-Ezel-300x202.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> The ConceptD 3 notebook is a laptop designed for creators who prefer a more traditional laptop form factor.
