Minister of Cooperative Governance and Traditional Affairs, Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma has released amended regulations related to the “advanced level 3” lockdown rules. The amended regulations relax many limitations on sit-down restaurants, cinemas, theatres, conferences, casinos, hotels, and bed and breakfasts. These new rules follow a media briefing by Tourism Minister Mmamoloko Kubayi-Ngubane who outlined new rules related to sit-down restaurants and other parts of the tourism sector. Kubayi-Ngubane said sit-down restaurants are allowed to open from Monday 29 June, given that they adhere to safety guidelines. The guidelines include that restaurants are only allowed 50 guests or 50% of their capacity, screening questionnaires for all diners are compulsory and all diners must wear cloth masks. It is still prohibited to consume alcohol at sit-down restaurants, which means having wine with your meal is not allowed. Social distancing at restaurants are compulsory and customers must always be kept at least 1.5 meters apart when queuing, paying, or dining. Libraries, museums and art galleries are allowed to open as long as they adhere to the health and social distancing guidelines. Cinemas, theatres and conferences are also allowed to open, but there may not be more than 50 guests in these venues. The amended regulations still restrict exercise between 06:00 and 18:00, but it can now be done in groups of up to four people. There were a few restrictions on travel and public areas which remain in place despite expectations that they will be lifted. Accommodation – hotels and accredited bed and breakfasts – are only allowed for business travel and does not allow for leisure travel. Public parks and beaches will remain closed during advanced level 3 lockdown. The table below provides an overview of the new advanced level 3 lockdown rules in South Africa.
