Professor Mary-Ann Davies, director at the Centre for Infectious Disease Epidemiology and Research at the University of Cape Town, shed further light on the latest data during a panel discussion. According to a presentation by Davies, current risk factors for dying from COVID-19 include older age, being male, diabetes, cardiac disease, respiratory disease, kidney disease, and liver disease. The presentation by Davies also showed how much each risk factor contributed to COVID-19 deaths in the Western Cape. People who are overweight, have had an organ transplant, or were recently diagnosed with cancer also have a higher chance of dying from the coronavirus. The data showed that for every 100 people in the public sector who died from COVID-19, 52 can be attributed to diabetes. 19 of the deaths can be attributed to high blood pressure, 9 to kidney disease, 12 to HIV, two to current TB infections and four to previous TB infections.
