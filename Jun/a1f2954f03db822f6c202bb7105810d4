In April, Vodacom announced that Joosub has heeded the call by President Cyril Ramaphosa and will donate a third of his salary for the next three months to the Solidarity Fund. The fund enables individuals and organisations to contribute to the detection and prevention of COVID-19, to provide care for those that need medical care and to support those whose lives have been disrupted by the health crisis. “President Cyril Ramaphosa set an incredible example by announcing that he would be taking a one-third pay cut for the next three months and that his entire cabinet will do the same,” said Joosub. “I, too, will heed the President’s call by donating a third of my salary for the next three months to the Solidarity Fund and call on other CEOs to follow suit.” “Not only is it the right thing to do but it will, in a small way, help towards South Africa’s recovery from the pandemic.”
