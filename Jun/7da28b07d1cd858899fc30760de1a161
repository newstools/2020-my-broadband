The Department of Higher Education and Training has published a new directive outlining the students that will be allowed to return under South Africa’s coronavirus lockdown levels. In addition to the health and safety instructions that must be followed, the directive also provides return plans for all of the country’s major university degrees as well as the return of students to on-campus residences. “All private and public higher education institutions must ensure that their infrastructure and facilities meet the requirements for the return of staff and students,” the department said. “No student or staff member should return to campus or residences until they have received communication from their institution that they are able to do so.” It added that students will require the relevant permit for return before travelling to the campus. The return of students is outlined in more detail below. A maximum of 33% of the student population return to each campus/delivery site for teaching, learning and assessment, in line with the following criteria: Small private higher education institutions with a student enrolment of less than 50 students, may apply to the Department for exemption from these criteria. Students in the following programmes requiring clinical training will be allowed to return, subject to the above.
