MTN users have reported network problems that are causing slow or no Internet connectivity, as well as problems with voice calls. Downdetector has shown a spike in reports of problems from MTN customers since 06:00 on Sunday. The issues appear to be affecting mobile data for MTN mobile and LTE customers, as well as fibre customers who have packages from Supersonic, MTN’s fibre ISP. The Downdetector map shows that the majority of reports stem from Gauteng, KwaZulu-Natal, the Eastern Cape, and the Western Cape. MTN has acknowledged the problem in response to complaints on Twitter, stating that it is working on restoring Internet connectivity across its platforms. The company also sent an SMS to affected users stating that there is currently no estimated time for service restoration. “We are aware of the service issues you are experiencing and we are attending to it as a matter of urgency,” MTN told customers. “We do not have an ETR as yet. We apologise for any inconvenience caused.” The image below shows the spike in Downdetector reports for MTN since 06:00 on Sunday morning. <img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-339901" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/MTN-downtime-640x259.jpg" alt="MTN downtime" width="640" height="259" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/MTN-downtime-640x259.jpg 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/MTN-downtime-600x243.jpg 600w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/MTN-downtime-768x311.jpg 768w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/MTN-downtime-1200x485.jpg 1200w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/MTN-downtime.jpg 1489w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" />
