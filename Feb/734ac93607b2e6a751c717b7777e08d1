MultiChoice offers DStv customers a number of bouquets, each of which has its own selection of channels and perks. For example, DStv Compact is priced at R399 per month and offers viewers 118 channels, while DStv Premium offers 150 channels and is priced at R809 per month. DStv Premium also includes a free subscription to Showmax. Each bouquet’s offering can also change when DStv launches new channels or makes channels available to viewers on lower-subscription tiers. We’ve detailed some of the most recent changes below and compared the current offerings and prices of the DStv Compact, Compact Plus, and Premium bouquets. In November 2019, MultiChoice announced that it had launched two new DStv channels – CBS Justice and CuriosityStream. CBS Justice is a 24/7 crime channel which is available to Premium and Compact Plus subscribers on DStv channel 170. CuriosityStream is a Premium-only offering and is being aired on channel 185. The company also said it would bring more shows from its higher-level bouquets to DStv Compact subscribers.
