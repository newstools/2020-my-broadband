Rain has launched a new 5G product, called the Standard Plan, which offers subscribers an uncapped 30Mbps service for R699 per month. The operator’s existing 5G package – which offers speeds of over 200Mbps –  has been renamed to the Premium Plan. Rain launched its commercial 5G service on 11 November 2019, offering subscribers unlimited data at speeds of up to 700Mbps for R1,000 per month. Since launch Rain has doubled its 5G coverage which was achieved by adding more sites and providing a new 5G router to users. Rain’s Chief Marketing Officer Khaya Dlanga said the latest version of Rain’s 5G router can be used both indoors and outdoors. He added that Rain is planning to expand its 5G coverage to Cape Town and Durban in 2020. Rain has launched a new, cheaper uncapped 5G product and it no longer requires customers to enter into a 24-month contract. “Customers can now have access to the rain 5G network on a month-to-month basis, plus a free-to-use 5G router as long as the customer’s 5G account is paid up,” the company said. This change also automatically applies to anyone who may have already signed up as a contract user during the past few months. Customer can upgrade from Standard to Premium effective immediately. Downgrading to the Standard plan will happen on the first of the following month. The table below shows Rain’s two 5G products side-by-side.
