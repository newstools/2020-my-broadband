Many Rain 5G subscribers are complaining that the service goes down during load-shedding, leaving them with 4G access only. While the 4G fallback works for many Rain 5G subscribers, others complained that the service becomes nearly unusable. “When I fall back on 4G I cannot game like I usually do on 5G and I get barely any throughput for normal Internet tasks,” said one user. Another user said when he gets dropped to 4G during load-shedding he cannot open YouTube and his experience equates to using a 56k dialup modem. This is in contrast to Rain’s 5G service when there is no load-shedding, which he said offers him exceptional speeds with download speeds well above 400Mbps. Another complaint is that 5G sites do not always come back online after load-shedding its stopped, which can result in prolonged downtime. Rain CEO Willem Roos told MyBroadband that the Rain 5G towers do not have large backup batteries to keep the sites up during load-shedding. While the towers are equipped with small backup batteries to ensure the orderly shutdown of the base station, it does not support the continued service during load-shedding. This means that Rain’s 5G network goes down during load-shedding and comes back up when power is restored to the area. Roos said the simple reason for not having battery and generator power backup to protect against load-shedding is the cost of the hardware. “It would substantially increase the cost of providing the service, and given that we do have 4G backup in these areas, we believe this strategy achieves the best balance of ensuring connectivity at affordable cost,” Roos said. Roos added that there have been some intermittent problems with the new 5G network – not necessarily related to load-shedding – but that they resolve these as quickly as possible.
