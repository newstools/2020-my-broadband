Samsung has unveiled its new Galaxy S20 smartphone lineup, which comprises the Galaxy S20, S20+, and S20 Ultra. The new devices all sport overhauled camera systems and 5G connectivity in addition to improved display technology. While the 5G Galaxy S20 models will not be available in South Africa at launch due to the lack of a mobile 5G network with widespread coverage, the LTE variants of the devices boast the same high-end specifications. The Samsung Galaxy S20 range is set to compete with Apple’s iPhone 11 lineup, which was unveiled in September 2019. Apple’s iPhone 11 Pro and Pro Max are the most advanced smartphones the company has made to date, boasting impressive displays and chipset performance. We compared Samsung’s new Galaxy S20 smartphones with Apple’s iPhone 11 and iPhone 11 Pro lineup. Samsung’s Galaxy S20 Ultra is the flagship of the new range, offering a highly-advanced camera system with up to 100x Super Resolution zoom. It boasts a quad-lens primary camera with a 108MP primary sensor, allowing for ultra-high resolution photos. All of the new Galaxy S20 devices feature impressive camera systems, with all three devices capable of recording high-quality 8K video. The Galaxy S20 Ultra also boasts 10x telephoto zoom and a dedicated TOF lens which delivers improved depth sensor effects. Apple’s iPhone 11 devices also have better camera systems than the previous generation of devices. Both the iPhone 11 Pro and 11 Pro Max feature triple-camera systems which comprise a 12MP wide lens, 12MP ultra-wide lens, and a 12MP telephoto lens. This delivers optical zoom of up to 2x and the ability to shoot 4K 60fps video with slow-motion functionality. The iPhone 11 Pro’s TrueDepth front-facing camera supports Smart HDR technology and offers a wider angle for better selfies. Apple does not publish the memory or battery capacity specifications of its devices, but it has been reported that the iPhone 11, 11 Pro, and 11 Pro Max all have 4GB of RAM. This is significantly lower than the 8GB of RAM present on the Samsung Galaxy S20, and it pales in comparison to the 12GB of memory in the Galaxy S20 Ultra. All the Samsung and Apple devices have Wi-Fi 6 connectivity and Bluetooth 5.0, as well as IP68 water and dust resistance ratings. Apple’s iPhone 11 range is powered by its A13 Bionic chipset, while Samsung’s Galaxy S20 lineup uses its new Exynos 990 processor, which includes support for a 5G modem. Below is the South African pricing for the Samsung Galaxy S20 models which will be available in South Africa from 6 March.
