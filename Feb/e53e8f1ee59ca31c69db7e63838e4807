LG has launched the V60 ThinQ 5G smartphone – its latest competitor to the foldable devices from Huawei and Samsung. The V60 ThinQ 5G has a 6.8-inch FHD+ display and a second detachable “screen accessory” of the same size and specifications. This second display allows users to multitask by operating a different app on each screen. Alternatively, users can turn the device around and use the second display as a keyboard, allowing them to use their V60 ThinQ 5G like a laptop. “Our strategy is to introduce differentiated 5G devices to meet the rise in consumer demands as the global 5G market matures,” said Morris Lee, president of LG’ Mobile Communication. “The LG V60 ThinQ 5G with the Dual Screen is the ideal device for consumers who love to create, consume and share content in the 5G era.” This isn’t LG’s first dual-screen smartphone – the LG G8X ThinQ launched in December 2019 and the V50 ThinQ 5G device launched in May 2019, both with dual-screen configurations. However, the V60 ThinQ 5G offers improved hardware and performance over its predecessor. It sports 8GB RAM and up to 256GB of storage space – improvements on 6GB and 128GB respectively. It also uses Qualcomm’s powerful Snapdragon 865 processor – which is the same chip used in certain regions for the Samsung S20 series – and X55 5G modem. The large 5,000mAh battery is important, too, as it is likely necessary to have such a large battery to power a dual-screen device. The LG V60 ThinQ 5G smartphone has a dual-lens primary camera system including a 64MP primary lens and a super-wide 13MP secondary lens. This camera system also has a ToF sensor. LG has not provided pricing for the device, but it said the V60 ThinQ would launch in March in key markets in North America, Europe, and Asia. <img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-340359" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/lg-thinq-5g-p3-640x430.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="430" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/lg-thinq-5g-p3-640x430.jpg 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/lg-thinq-5g-p3-595x400.jpg 595w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/lg-thinq-5g-p3-300x202.jpg 300w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/lg-thinq-5g-p3-768x516.jpg 768w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/lg-thinq-5g-p3-1536x1032.jpg 1536w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/lg-thinq-5g-p3-1200x806.jpg 1200w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/lg-thinq-5g-p3.jpg 2000w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> <img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-340363" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/lg-thinq-5g-p2-640x430.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="430" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/lg-thinq-5g-p2-640x430.jpg 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/lg-thinq-5g-p2-595x400.jpg 595w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/lg-thinq-5g-p2-300x202.jpg 300w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/lg-thinq-5g-p2-768x516.jpg 768w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/lg-thinq-5g-p2-1536x1033.jpg 1536w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/lg-thinq-5g-p2-1200x807.jpg 1200w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/lg-thinq-5g-p2.jpg 2000w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> <img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-340365" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/v60-ThinQ-5G-p1-640x430.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="430" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/v60-ThinQ-5G-p1-640x430.jpg 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/v60-ThinQ-5G-p1-595x400.jpg 595w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/v60-ThinQ-5G-p1-300x202.jpg 300w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/v60-ThinQ-5G-p1-768x516.jpg 768w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/v60-ThinQ-5G-p1-1536x1032.jpg 1536w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/v60-ThinQ-5G-p1-1200x806.jpg 1200w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/v60-ThinQ-5G-p1.jpg 2000w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> <img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-340367" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/V60-ThinQ-5G-Headline-Image-640x430.jpg" alt="V60 ThinQ 5G Headline Image" width="640" height="430" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/V60-ThinQ-5G-Headline-Image.jpg 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/V60-ThinQ-5G-Headline-Image-595x400.jpg 595w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/V60-ThinQ-5G-Headline-Image-300x202.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" />
