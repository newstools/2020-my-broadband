South Africa’s Wireless Application Service Providers’ Association (WASPA) has opened nominations for its 2020/2021 board member positions. According to WASPA’s Constitution, four of the current board members are required to stand down at the Annual General Meeting (AGM) in March. The four outgoing members are Conrad Geldenhuys, James McNab, Michiel Huisamen, and Sipho Bengu. These members are eligible for re-election, however. The other three board members – Anthony Ekerold, Gregory Brophy, and Lianda Holleman – will remain to serve their second term until the 2021 AGM. WASPA amended its Constitution two years ago to provide for a board which replaced the former Management Committee structure in place since the Association’s founding in 2004. WASPA said that potential board candidates are nominated by the Association’s members. “While nominees do not have to be affiliated with a WASPA member, WASPA members in good standing elect the Association’s Board members after receiving written nominations outlining nominees’ industry-related experience, interests and other pertinent information,” the Association stated. “WASPA’s laudable mission of creating a fair and equitable mobile landscape that values consumers while advancing the interests of the plethora of small, medium and large mobile firms that make our WASP industry so exciting, and such a key contributor to the cellular sector, must continue. It can only continue with the right talent, right at the top,” WASPA said. For more information on the structure and duties of the Board members, view Section 6 of the WASPA Constitution. To indicate interest in serving on the WASPA Board, or to nominate another candidate to serve, interested parties must email secretariat@waspa.org.za. Applications must include an abbreviated half-page biography, in addition to a succinct motivation for wanting to serve on the Board, WASPA said. The closing date for applications is 29 February 2020.
