There is a major outage affecting the Johannesburg region of Frogfoot’s fibre network, the fibre network operator has told MyBroadband. Frogfoot explained that it is still the “heat of the moment” with all their technical people focusing their attention on fixing the problem. Information about the details of the issue will therefore only be available later. A spokesperson for the company could only reveal that there is a major issue in Johannesburg. This will impact connectivity for clients in a significant portion of the country because their traffic is aggregated in Johannesburg. Clients as far south as Bloemfontein are affected, as are towns in the eastern region like Ermelo. Tshwane and its surrounds are also affected. All of Frogfoot’s other network regions are unaffected. Dear valued customers, please be aware that we are experiencing a network outage in the Gauteng region and parts of Bloemfontein. Our teams are actively working at resolving this and will post a further update as soon as possible. — Frogfoot Fibre (@FFFibre) February 5, 2020
