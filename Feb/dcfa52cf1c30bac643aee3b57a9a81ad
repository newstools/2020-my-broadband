Apple Mac computers saw nearly double the amount of malware compared to Windows PCs in 2019. This is one of the key findings contained in the 2020 State of Malware Report compiled by Malwarebytes. According to the report, the overall volume of Mac threats increased by more than 400% year-on-year. Although this figure is impacted by more users installing Malwarebytes for Mac on their systems, threats per endpoint on Macs outpaced PCs by a ratio of 2:1. Detections per endpoint increased from 4.8 in 2018 to 11.0, compared to the 5.8 measured on Windows systems in 2019. The most prevalent instance was a form of adware called NewTab, which was detected 30 million times in 2019. NewTab tries to redirect searches in the web browser in order to earn illicit affiliate revenue. The report further detailed a global increase in threats targeting businesses, with a 13% year-on-year rise. The main culprits were aggressive adware, Trojans, and HackTools. “Organizations were once again hammered with Emotet and TrickBot, two Trojan-turned-botnets that surfaced in the top five threats for nearly every region of the globe, and in the top detections for the services, retail, and education industries,” the report stated. Net ransomware activity has also soared to record highs, in particular the Sodinokibi and Ryuk families of ransomware, which rose by as much as 820% and 543%, respectively.
