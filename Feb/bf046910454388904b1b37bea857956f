Samsung has unveiled its new Galaxy S20 smartphone lineup, which includes the Galaxy S20, S20+, and S20 Ultra. These smartphones all have improved cameras, better displays, and are available with 5G support. However, these 5G versions will not be available in South Africa, as the country does not have a mobile 5G network with significant coverage. The Galaxy S20 is a serious upgrade over Samsung’s previous premium flagship smartphone – the Galaxy S10. The Galaxy S10e competes with the Galaxy S20, the Galaxy S10 competes with the S20+, and the S10+ and S20 Ultra are the top smartphones in each range. This is how these smartphones match up. The Galaxy S10e has two camera lenses, including a 16MP primary lens. In contrast, the S20 has a significantly improved triple-lens system, including a 64MP lens. The Galaxy S20+ offers the same powerful camera system as the S20, but with an additional TOF sensor for improved depth perception. In comparison, both the S10 and S10+ only have triple-lens camera systems. The S20 Ultra’s camera array steals the show, however. It has an incredible 108MP primary lens, as well as three other lenses and 10x telephoto zoom. Additionally, all three of the Galaxy S20 devices can record high-quality 8K video content. All smartphones in the Galaxy S20 range use the Exynos 990 processor – which is an upgrade from the chipset found in the S10 range. Likewise, both the Galaxy S20 and Galaxy S20+ offer more RAM than their previous-generation equivalents. Another notable difference between the two devices can be found in their displays. The new range sports significantly larger displays across all three devices – peaking at 6.9-inches for the S20 Ultra compared to the 6.4-inch display of the S10+. The S20 range’s displays also offer an increased 120Hz frame rate – which is particularly useful for mobile gamers. The updated range also uses a USB 3.2 Type-C port for charging and data transfers – an upgrade on the USB 3.1 Type-C port used by the S10 range. The full specifications of these devices can be found below. <img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-338502" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/S10e-vs-S20-640x430.jpg" alt="S10e vs S20" width="640" height="430" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/S10e-vs-S20-640x430.jpg 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/S10e-vs-S20-595x400.jpg 595w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/S10e-vs-S20-300x202.jpg 300w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/S10e-vs-S20-768x516.jpg 768w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/S10e-vs-S20-1536x1032.jpg 1536w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/S10e-vs-S20-1200x807.jpg 1200w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/S10e-vs-S20.jpg 1760w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> <img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-338494" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/s10-vs-s20-640x430.jpg" alt="s10 vs s20+" width="640" height="430" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/s10-vs-s20-640x430.jpg 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/s10-vs-s20-595x400.jpg 595w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/s10-vs-s20-300x202.jpg 300w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/s10-vs-s20-768x516.jpg 768w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/s10-vs-s20-1536x1033.jpg 1536w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/s10-vs-s20-1200x807.jpg 1200w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/s10-vs-s20.jpg 1731w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> <img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-338504" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Galaxy-S10-vs-S20-Ultra-640x430.jpg" alt="Galaxy S10+ vs S20 Ultra" width="640" height="430" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Galaxy-S10-vs-S20-Ultra.jpg 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Galaxy-S10-vs-S20-Ultra-595x400.jpg 595w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Galaxy-S10-vs-S20-Ultra-300x202.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" />
