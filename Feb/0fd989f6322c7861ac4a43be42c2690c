The Information reports that YouTube is considering working with subscription-based streaming services to allow users to sign up to these products through its platform. “The Google-owned video giant is considering giving people the ability to sign up, through YouTube, for a wide range of subscription-streaming services run by entertainment companies, according to people familiar with the situation,” said the report. However, the sources said it was unclear which services YouTube has been discussing partnerships with. This would follow in the footsteps of services such as the Apple TV app and Amazon’s Prime Video Channels, which allow users to access a variety of subscription content through their platforms. Facebook has also tried to offer video subscriptions via its Watch platform but soon gave up on the project due to a lack of interest in the offer. YouTube has taken several measures to expand its video-hosting service in recent years. This includes its YouTube Music service, which competes with Spotify and Deezer, as well as its YouTube Premium subscription product. YouTube Premium gives users access to YouTube Music, as well as advert-free viewing, video downloads, and YouTube Original content.
