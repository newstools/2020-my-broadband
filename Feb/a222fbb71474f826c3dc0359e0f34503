Uber Eats has announced that its food delivery service is now available in Polokwane. Uber Eats South Africa general manager Ailyssa Pretorius said the company is excited to bring the app’s convenience, affordability, and reliability to the capital of Limpopo. “Uber Eats will focus on unlocking potential and increasing the overall earning capacity for both individuals who deliver through the app and restaurants alike,” Pretorius said. “It’s important that we work with locals, on the ground, to help them grow their business and make the most of the app’s technology to further grow their business. To ensure that the app provides more than just a service, but truly complements the many lifestyles of locals,” Pretorius added. Polokwane joins Johannesburg, Pretoria, Cape Town, Stellenbosch, and Durban as locations where Uber Eats is available. Uber Eats said residents will be able to order from a variety of takeaway outlets and local restaurants in the city. “While well-known franchises are available including KFC, McDonalds and Mochachos, it’s the homegrown restaurants that are a firm favourite, with The Grind and Tenpin on Grimm accessible via the app.” Just like in other areas, availability of restaurants will likely depend on the user’s exact location. The Uber Eats app is available for Android and iOS devices from the Google Play and Apple App stores, respectively. New users can sign-up and use the code “HOWZITPLK“ to receive R75 off their first order with a minimum basket value of R100.
