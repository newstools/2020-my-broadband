Eskom has announced that load-shedding will be halted at 17:00 on Saturday and will resume again at 08:00 on Sunday 23 February. The power utility did not specify whether load-shedding would continue at stage 2 on Sunday or whether another stage would be implemented. Eskom said it was able to stop load-shedding on Saturday due to improved system performance and the return of two power generation units this morning. It also has not confirmed when this next phase of load-shedding will end. “Eskom will stop rotational load-shedding at 17:00 today, owing to an improved generation system performance, which has given us room to provide some relief to customers during the night,” Eskom said. “We will resume implementing rotational load-shedding on Sunday at 08:00.” Unplanned breakdowns were at 10,553MW as of 08:00 this morning, with planned maintenance at 5,679MW. “Even though we can provide some relief tonight, the system remains unpredictable and constrained, and as such we remind customer that any shift in the system performance will require a change in the stage of load-shedding at short notice,” Eskom said. This follows after Eskom announced that stage 2 load-shedding will continue throughout the weekend until 06:00 on Sunday. Eskom is also currently engaged in a court battle with Nersa over tariff increases. The North Gauteng High Court has dismissed the power utility’s urgent application to receive R58.5 billion from customers through two big price increases. Eskom had applied for the price of electricity to increase by 16.6% on 1 April 2020, with a further 16.7% price hike on 1 April 2021. #POWERALERT 1Date: 22 February 2020 Rotational loadshedding will stop at 17:00 today, and will resume again on Sunday at 08:00 @SABCNewsOnline @SABCRadio @IOL @eNCA @ewnupdates @News24 @SAgovnews @TheSAnews pic.twitter.com/18GBe6V4yz — Eskom Hld SOC Ltd (@Eskom_SA) February 22, 2020
