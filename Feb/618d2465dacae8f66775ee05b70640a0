Eskom has announced it will stop Stage 2 load-shedding at 21:00 on Sunday and implement Stage 1 from 09:00 on Monday. The power utility said this was because there had been an adequate recovery in emergency reserves. “While dam levels have recovered adequately enough to allow for a reduction to Stage 1 load-shedding, there is still some work being done to improve diesel stocks,” Eskom stated. “Unplanned outages or breakdowns were at 11,126MW as at 16:00 today. Our teams are working hard to reduce the unplanned outages,” it added. Eskom stated that the risk of load-shedding remains for the week and advised customers that any additional shifts in demand or on the system could prompt a change in the load-shedding stage. “We therefore request customers to help reduce demand and use electricity sparingly, taking into consideration that better managed demand will shorten this bout of load-shedding.” Eskom said it wished to remind South Africans that there is a heightened possibility of load-shedding for the next 18 months due to the critical maintenace required to restore the ageing plant to good health. It said it will provide the public with further updates on the state of the system on Monday afternoon.
