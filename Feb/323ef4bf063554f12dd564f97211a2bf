Microsoft has filed a patent for its Surface Neo foldable tablet that implies it could function as a gaming device. According to PatentlyApple, Microsoft’s patent for the Surface Neo includes an attachment that could be used as a game controller. “In other implementations, the input device #102 could be manifest as a trackpad or game controller, among others,” said Microsoft in the patent document. The patent was filed in Q3 2018 but was only published yesterday by the US Patent Office. It is unlikely that the Neo will pack high-end gaming hardware. Instead, it is expected to offer gaming via Microsoft’s Project xCloud streaming platform. Game streaming allows almost any device to run high-end video games, as the graphics are not processed locally. It looks like Microsoft could add features outside of traditional gaming hardware to improve this xCloud gaming experience for Surface Neo owners. The Surface Neo was unveiled in October 2019 and comprises two 9-inch screens separated by a hinge in the middle. Microsoft has not unveiled any pricing for the Surface Neo, although the device is expected to release some time this year.
