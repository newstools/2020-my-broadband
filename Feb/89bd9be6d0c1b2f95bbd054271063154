A number of Absa customers have complained of issues when accessing the mobile banking app. Customers who use iPhones were unable to log in to their mobile banking app this week after their device details were mistakenly erased from Absa’s systems. This requires them to re-link their device with their account on the Absa banking app. “We can confirm that a small number of our iOS app users have experienced technical challenges when they were asked to relink their device on the app,” Absa Customer Value Management managing executive Christine Wu told MyBroadband. “This is limited to some Apple/iOS devices.  Our technical teams have rectified the issue and released an updated Absa Banking App on the Apple App Store.” Wu advised affected customers to update their Absa banking application and then re-link their account. To do this, customers are required to provide the following information: One affected reader told MyBroadband that they were unable to verify their online banking login as this requires app-based verification. This reader was also unable to re-link their device to the banking app as they were logging into an account for which the card had expired. Absa had not issued the customer with a new card, meaning they were unable to re-verify their device and access the banking app. “Customers whose cards have expired are urged to contact our call centre or visit a branch as soon as possible,” Wu said. The video below outlines the re-registration process for the Absa banking app on iOS devices.
