Netflix has added an option to turn off autoplay previews for shows and movies on the app’s home screen. Subscribers may be happy to hear that preview clips or trailers that play automatically as you browse through the Netflix library can now be turned off. Engadget noted that auto-previews have been part of the streaming service for five years. The feature may not only be annoying for some, but it also consumes more data. To turn autoplay preview off, you will have to sign in to your Netflix account on a web browser, click the drop-down button to the right of your profile picture, and select Manage Profiles. After choosing the relevant profile, navigate to the “Autoplay previews while browsing on all devices” setting and uncheck the box next to it. Click save and your new preference will be stored. Another update for Netflix was announced yesterday, as the company said it would start using a new codec for streaming on its mobile app. The Av1 codec provides 20% better compression efficiency over the older codec, which means it consumes less data. The company plans to gradually roll out the codec to apps on its other platforms as well.
