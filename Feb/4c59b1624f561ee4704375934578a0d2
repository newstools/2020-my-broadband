Bitcoin will transform our current financial systems and eliminate segregation created by countries’ borders. This is is the view of Farzam Ehsani, the CEO of South Africa cryptocurrency exchange VALR. Ehsani was not always a Bitcoin advocate, however, and when he first heard about the technology he was skeptical. “When I first heard about Bitcoin, I thought it was a scam. When it’s price fell from over $1,100 in late 2013 to less than $250, I felt vindicated in this belief,” said Ehsani. “Then I spoke to a close friend in San Francisco, who founded a start-up in the Bitcoin space in 2014.” Ehsani suggested to his friend that he should be doing “more worthy things” with his life, but his friend replied with: “Farzam, I don’t think you understand what Bitcoin and blockchain technology are. Let me explain.” “Since then I’ve been captivated by technology, and specifically the promise that cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin hold for transforming our current financial system.” Ehsani’s journey into the working world started with him attending primary and secondary school in Kenya, and then UC Berkeley in California. His first real job was as a resident assistant at the International House at UC Berkeley, where he was paid $9 per hour. He then went on to work at Deloitte Consulting, McKinsey, and Rand Merchant Bank (RMB). “I worked hard, but I was also very lucky to have these opportunities,” said Ehsani. His big break in the blockchain scene arrived when he was asked to help set up RMB’s Fintech Unit in January 2016, after “asking many questions to the bank’s leadership about Bitcoin and blockchain technology”. “At the time no one had heard of the term ‘blockchain’, and everyone associated Bitcoin with drugs and the dark net,” he said. After leading the blockchain work at the bank for over two years, he realized there was a “limited appetite” for banks to enter the cryptocurrency space. “I then left to start VALR with my co-founders.” Founding a company has many rewards, said Ehsani, including the ability to create a product from scratch that serves tens of thousands of people. “And the ability to do this on one’s own terms – along with one’s team – is even better.” A leadership role is all-consuming, particularly in the early stages of a start-up, though, and taking a holiday is an “elusive concept”, he said. For South Africans who would like to advance their carriers in the tech space, or break into it for the first time, Ehsani said you cannot take no for an answer. “Don’t be afraid of failing. Don’t worry about what other people think. And if you want a career at a particular company, don’t just submit your CV,” he said. “Pick up the phone, call the company, ask to speak to their HR department, and request a meeting to introduce yourself and find out more about the company.” “And when you’re ready, think about going out on your own and creating something beautiful for the world.” Ehsani’s personal tech choices are detailed below. <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-300122" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Apple-Airpods-2.png" alt="Apple Airpods 2" width="640" height="431" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Apple-Airpods-2.png 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Apple-Airpods-2-300x202.png 300w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Apple-Airpods-2-594x400.png 594w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Apple-Airpods-2-639x430.png 639w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> Which smartphone do you use?
