The Guardian reported that the Microsoft founder Bill Gates has commissioned a R9.7-billion ($644 million) hydrogen-powered superyacht, complete with an infinity pool, helipad, spa, and gym. However, Sinot Yacht Architecture and Design, which is behind the hydrogen-powered superyacht, denied that Gates has purchased the vessel. “The hydrogen Aqua concept is not linked to Mr Gates or his representatives in any form or matter,” the company said. Sinot added that it has no business relationship with Gates and that the Aqua is a concept yacht which is currently under development. Sander Sinot said they took inspiration for the 112m superyacht from the lifestyle of a discerning, forward-looking owner for the development of Aqua. The yacht addressed the requirement for privacy and space with a large owner’s pavilion and has been designed to provide those on board with the closest possible proximity to the water. The aft deck features a series of platforms cascading down towards the sea, while a large platform allows passengers to access the water at sea level. The Aqua superyacht will be powered by liquid hydrogen and fuel-cell technology, which Sander Sinot said was one of their biggest challenges. At the lower decks, the usual parameters for propulsion, range, and speed have been translated into a complete hydrogen-electric system. The Aqua hydrogen-powered superyacht has a maximum speed of 17 knots and a cruising speed of 10 – 12 knots. It has a range of 3,750 nautical miles and has an electrical power generation capability of 4MW using PEM fuel cells and liquified hydrogen. It has a capacity for 14 guests with 4 guests state rooms, 2 VIP state rooms, and 1 owner pavilion. <img class="aligncenter wp-image-338170 size-large"
