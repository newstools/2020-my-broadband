Stage 3 load-shedding will be implemented from 09:00 today until 05:00 on Monday, 17 February, said Eskom. Eskom made the announcement following the implementation of stage 2 load-shedding this weekend. It said that its diesel reserves for its open cycle gas turbines and water reserves for its pumped storage schemes were both at low levels, following their utilization, and could therefore not be used to sustain the shortage in power supply today. Unplanned outages or breakdowns were at 10,612MW as of 06:00 this morning, added Eskom. #POWERALERT 1
