A R1.2-billion solar farm project has been approved by the National Treasury, Kannaland municipal manager Reynold Stevens has confirmed. Stevens announced the project during an oversight visit to the Garden Route district municipality on Wednesday, adding that it would be a public-private partnership between Kannaland Municipality and InnovSure to provide an alternative source of green energy to the municipality. ”This is a fantastic initiative as this investment will create job opportunities and the company will further invest R42 million per annum in the Kannaland Municipality for critical infrastructure projects and further assist the Municipality with smart technology,” said DA MPP Deidre Baartman. “Government cannot tackle the country’s energy crisis on its own,” Baartman said. “It is vital that we break down the national government’s monopoly on energy generation and provision, and bring in the private sector to diversify this industry as a matter of urgency.” “The Kannaland solar farm is a prime example of this.” During off-peak periods, the solar farm will also be able to draw energy from Eskom and store it for release later. This power can be used to supplement shortages during peak hours and sent to nearby municipalities such as Mossel Bay. “I will be monitoring this development closely to ensure that the Western Cape attains energy independence from Eskom to grow our provincial economy and create much needed jobs,” Baartman said. The DA said it remains committed to cutting red tape and using innovation to grow its provincial economy and create jobs.
