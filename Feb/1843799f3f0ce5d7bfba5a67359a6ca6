Registrars have criticised ICANN’s decision to allow .com domain prices to be raised by up to 70% over the next decade. Verisign, the company that administers the .com domain, will be allowed to increase the pricing of .com domains to registrars by 7% per year until 2023. After this, there will be a two-year gap where price increases will not take place, followed by 7% increases from 2026 to 2029. This will become a continuous trend – four years of 7% increases, followed by two years of no increase. It is unclear how much of these increases will be passed on to the consumer. As part of the agreement, Verisign will pay ICANN an additional $20 million dollars over the next five years which will be used to support ICANN’s efforts to ensure the security and stability of the domain name system. Domain registrar Namecheap has published a blog post criticising the decision to enact these price increases. “ICANN and Verisign made these changes in secret, without consulting or incorporating feedback from the ICANN community or Internet users,” said Namecheap. “Over 3,500 comments were submitted in support of price controls for the .org, .info, and .biz top-level domains (TLDs). Only six comments supported removing price controls,” the registrar added. “These changes will have a significant impact on the Internet for years to come.”
