Microsoft has released its unified Office app for Android devices. The all-in-one package includes several of the company’s productivity programs – Word, Excel, and PowerPoint – and was previously available as a public preview. The new app means users no longer have to switch between individual Microsoft programs to work with different types of files. The range of features on the unified Office app aligns with much of the functionality that is available on the desktop version. Among these, certain users may find the ability to work together on documents with collaborators or colleagues in real-time particularly useful. To easily turn physical paperwork into editable documents, you can take photos of documents to convert them into Word format, or take photos of tables that can be converted to Excel spreadsheets. Additionally, users can instantly create PDFs from photos or documents in Word, Excel, or PowerPoint. PDFs can be signed directly on the app by using your finger. The Office app is currently free to download and use, but a Microsoft Account with an Office 365 subscription is required to unlock “premium features” within the app. Android users can download the app from the Google Play Store. Microsoft has not yet indicated when to expect availability on iOS.
