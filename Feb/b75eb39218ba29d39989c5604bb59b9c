Huawei has launched the Y9s, a smartphone which the company said delivers premium performance with an attractive price tag. “The phone caters to the demands of young and trendy consumers, with its advanced camera, ample storage, and stunning display capabilities,” Huawei stated. Just like with the Y9 and Y9 Prime, a standout feature of the Y9s is its 16MP pop-up front camera, which allows it to offer users an uninterrupted 2,340 x 1,080 display with narrow bezels. On the rear, the Y9s boasts a triple-camera setup with advanced AI photography features. This includes a 48MP main camera, 8MP ultra-wide-angle lens with a 120-degree field-of-view, and a 2MP bokeh depth sensor. Huawei claimed the camera’s large sensor allows more light to enter in low-light situations. This feature, combined with Huawei’s AI algorithms, provides multi-frame noise reduction for night time photos and videos, According to Huawei, the camera supports long exposure shots up to 6 seconds, which improves image stabilisation. The Huawei Y9s comes with the mid-range octa-core Kirin 710F processor paired with 6GB RAM. For storage, the phone provides 128GB of space, with the option of expanding up to 512GB via microSD card. The phone’s 4,000 mAh battery is capable of powering the device for one to two days per charge, Huawei claimed. The Huawei Y9s is priced at R6,399 and is available from Telkom or the Huawei online store.
