Vodacom has concluded a deal with Rain to extend its roaming and facilities leasing agreements beyond its original agreement of 5,000 sites to virtually all Vodacom sites. This agreement will enable Vodacom to increase access to 4G capacity at more favourable terms. “This is an important agreement in an environment where spectrum remains a key capacity constraint for all networks,” Vodacom said. The agreement is using Rain’s 1,800MHz and 2,600MHz spectrum bands to enhance the capacity and performance of Vodacom’s network. The lease agreement with Vodacom will also help Rain to fast-track its network roll-out and make it more affordable. The agreement initially envisaged that Rain would  have at least 500 sites active on Vodacom’s infrastructure and facilities by March 2017, 2,000 by the end of 2017, and 5,000 by 2020. The new agreement with Vodacom means that Rain will have access to Vodacom’s full network, which sets it up for a full national roll-out.
