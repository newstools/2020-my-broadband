Volkswagen and electric utility company E.ON have revealed a prototype quick electric vehicle charger that can be deployed to conventional power sources without the need for additional infrastructure upgrades. The companies detailed the new “plug-and-play” technology in a statement released on Wednesday. The charger integrates a battery system, making it possible to install ultra-fast charging stations at a much lower cost without civil engineering or mains connection, the companies claimed. “The quick charging system can charge two e-cars with up to 150 kilowatts of power at the same time, thus providing an additional range of around 200 km on average in just 15 minutes,” the statement said. The charging station is fed by a standard 16- to 63-ampere power connection to ensure that it has sufficient capacity at all times. The increased availability of fast-charging stations could serve to ease anxiety over the viability of EVs for everyday use. One of the biggest challenges to mainstream adoption of the technology is the fact that charging electric cars takes much longer than filling up with conventional fuels. Tesla’s V3 Supercharger stations currently offer the fastest charging capability, with a peak rate of up to 250kW. This means it takes five minutes to add around 120km of range.
