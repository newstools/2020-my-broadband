Volkswagen has announced that its e-Golf pilot project has launched in South Africa, outlining the release timeline for its electric vehicles in South Africa. The e-Golf project will see six fully-electric vehicles being tested by motoring and lifestyle media, selected dealers, and Volkswagen employees to gain insight into the experience of driving an electric vehicle in South Africa. The company said that through the involvement of selected Volkswagen dealers in Gauteng and Western Cape, the project seeks to drive customer awareness and education around electric vehicles. VW added that its e-Golfs will also be used as shuttles and courtesy cars for Volkswagen customers during this period. “At Volkswagen, we want to democratise electric mobility and that is why the e-Golf pilot project is a key initiative for the brand,” said VW South Africa sales and marketing director Mike Glendinning. “With the help of our dealers, we want to get as many South Africans as possible to drive and experience an electric vehicle as this is the future of our brand.” VW will also offer fast-charging points in its Uitenhage manufacturing plant, as well as its Dealer Training Academy in Centurion, Gauteng. This pilot project is the first phase in the roll-out of VW electric vehicles in South Africa. The second phase will be expanded to include fully-electric Volkswagen ID.3 vehicles next year. The third and last phase will see the first fully-electric Volkswagen vehicles available for sale to customers in South Africa from 2022, the company said. “The e-Golf as well as the ID.3 will not be available for sale in South Africa and will be used solely for the purposes of ensuring as many South Africans as possible get to experience life with an electric vehicle,” VW added.
