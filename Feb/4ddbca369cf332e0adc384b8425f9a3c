Finance minister Tito Mboweni will deliver the national Budget Speech at 14hoo on Wednesday (26 February). The budget speech can be viewed through several channels, including TV services like DStv, news channels, and live-streaming sources like YouTube.

Key to this will be austerity measures around government spending. Projections tabled in the Medium-Term Budget Policy Statement (MTBPS) in October 2019 suggest that the fiscal deficit is heading towards 6.5% of GDP, said Allan Gray economist Sandy McGregor. “The immediate problem has been caused by the effective bankruptcy of Eskom and certain other parastatals,” he said. “This has triggered a crisis caused by a decade of unsustainably large increases in the public wage bill.” Mboweni is also expected to announce a number of tax hikes and adjustments, with some economists warning of a possible ‘one-off wealth tax‘ as well as a VAT increase. Other tax issues Mboweni is expected to cover include: However, analysts have warned that even if Mboweni presents a ‘good’ budget, it is unlikely to stop South Africa’s march to junk.
