F1 TV Pro, which allows users to watch live Formula 1 races through the official F1 streaming platform, is now available in South Africa. For years, fans of Formula 1 have been required to pay for DStv Premium to watch live races, pre-season testing, and more. F1 TV – the official online streaming platform for Formula 1 races – was made available in South Africa in 2018, but local viewers were still unable to watch live races as only the TV Access version was available. Subsequently, South African Formula 1 fans had to pay the R819 per month for DStv Premium to watch races live, or they had to find a restaurant or bar which showed the Grand Prix. F1 TV published a blog post on 6 February which detailed the pre-season testing dates and listed a number of new countries where F1 TV Pro was now available – including South Africa. F1 TV offers two products – F1 TV Access and F1 TV Pro. F1 TV Access allows viewers to watch full race replays and highlights with access to all F1 onboard cameras, and watch races from F1’s historic archive. This was the version of F1 TV previously available in South Africa, leaving local viewers with no official option for live streaming. F1 TV Pro, however, offers a live stream of every track session for all Grands Prix, access to all driver onboard cameras and team radios, and the ability to live stream the F1, F2, F3, and Porsche Supercup. This live offering is available in South Africa for the 2020 season, meaning that South Africans no longer need a DStv Premium subscription to watch every Grand Prix. The launch of F1 TV Pro is confirmed on the website’s content schedule, where South Africa’s offering is listed as on par with the United States. F1 TV Pro is priced in US dollars on the website, with separate monthly and annual subscription rates: New subscribers can get 25% off an annual subscription to F1 TV Pro using the EARLYBIRD25 promotion code if they sign up before 28 February 2020.
