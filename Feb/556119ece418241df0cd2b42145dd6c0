Toll-free numbers in the 086 range and other Telkom landline operations are down across the country due to an issue with Telkom’s network. Many companies have reported that their call centres, which operate in the toll-free number range, are unreachable and provided alternate numbers to customers until the problems are resolved. “Please note that our call centres are affected by a Telkom network issue,” Discovery South Africa said on Twitter. “We are working to resolve this as soon as possible.” Standard Bank also said that it was experiencing issues with its call centre, confirming that all 086 numbers across South Africa are down due to problems at Telkom. “You may find it difficult to contact our Call Centre currently as we are facing technical problems with our lines,” the bank said. “All 086 numbers countrywide are currently affected.” South African hosting provider Xneelo also confirmed that an outage at Telkom was affecting its toll-free number for its call centre. Switch Telecom told MyBroadband that it has observed failures on the Telkom network since 18:22 yesterday. “We have been in communication with Telkom and they advise that they are still working on the issue,” the company said. An industry source told MyBroadband that all of Telkom’s interconnections with other licensees are affected on a countrywide scale. They said that calls from Telkom landline numbers were failing but Telkom Mobile was unaffected, apart from being unable to call landlines. According to the source, these problems began last night and the system recovered this morning, but it has since failed again.
