Vodacom 4U will be the headline sponsor of the annual Rush esports event at the Rand Show, and will also be a sponsor of the Festival of Gaming event. “We’re very excited to be bringing the Rush esports tournament to the Rand Show and bringing the whole event to life,” said Vodacom 4U marketing director Ulanova Visser. “The Vodacom 4U team is counting down to showtime because it’s going to be a gaming experience the fans will be completely in awe of.” NAG and Rush owner Michael James said that both NAG and Rush are delighted at the partnership. “Rush is very fortunate to have such a progressive partner like Vodacom 4U involved in esports,” said James. “In the future, we’ll look back at companies like Vodacom 4U, and ventures like Rush as one of the true starting points for bringing South Africa closer to the current international esports scene.” The Rush esports event is in its fourth year and, according to NAG and Rush, will offer opportunities for a vast range of gamers – from beginners to those who consider themselves to be more hardcore. Tournaments that will take place at the Rush esports event are set to be announced this week. Rush will take place from 8-13 April 2020 at the Rand Show in Johannesburg.
