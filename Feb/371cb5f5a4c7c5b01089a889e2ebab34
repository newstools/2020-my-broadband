MultiChoice has announced its DStv subscription price changes for 2020, which includes a hike in Premium and Compact Plus subscription fees. The price of DStv’s Premium package has increased by R10 to R819 per month, while the Access Fee has increased by R5 to R100. Last year, MultiChoice did not increase the price of DStv Premium after it announced a “price freeze” for the year. The price of DStv Compact has stayed the same at R399, with the price of DStv Access increasing from R105 to R110. “We want to continue making DStv affordable and accessible to as many South Africans as possible by providing the best local and international content have come to love anywhere, anytime,” said MultiChoice South Africa CEO Mark Rayner. “DStv offers a number of bundles and payment options (annual, or monthly for 12 or 24 months with our contract offerings) and additional services like DStv Now to watch live TV anytime, anywhere, Showmax, Box Office and JOOX,” MultiChoice said. “Subscribers can even stream or download to watch later on DStv Now.” The company added that subscribers benefit from the array of entertainment from the continuous review of the platform’s content line-up and channel selection.
