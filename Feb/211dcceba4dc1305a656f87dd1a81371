Samsung has announced that Nedbank Mastercard cards are now supported on the Samsung Pay app. The announcement was made during Samsung’s 2020 Unpacked event. “Samsung Pay will go over 70% coverage of all the bank cards in South Africa,” the company said. Samsung also sent a notice to Nedbank customers informing them that they can now enrol their Nedbank Mastercard into Samsung Pay.  The Samsung Pay mobile app lets owners of selected Galaxy smartphones use their devices for payments. Users can link their bank card to their phone and use the device to pay at paypoint terminals. The system employs both NFC and MST technologies for secure payment. The app was originally launched in South Africa in August 2018, after a short early access period. At its launch, the payment platform supported Absa and Standard Bank cards, while FNB came onboard in March 2019. Other partner banks include Discovery, Investec, and RMB. <img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-338526" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Screenshot-2020-02-12-at-15.55.23-e1581515790737-640x324.png" alt="Nedbank Samsung Pay" width="640" height="324" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Screenshot-2020-02-12-at-15.55.23-e1581515790737-640x324.png 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Screenshot-2020-02-12-at-15.55.23-e1581515790737-600x304.png 600w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Screenshot-2020-02-12-at-15.55.23-e1581515790737.png 752w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" />
