Netflix has announced that it is rolling out its new Top 10 feature to users around the world. The company previously tested the feature in Mexico and the United Kingdom, and it has now officially launched the Top 10 list to users worldwide. “Whether you love books, music, films or TV, top 10 lists are a great way to find out what’s popular,” Netflix said. “So today we’re rolling out a new Top 10 feature on Netflix.” The Top 10 feature comprises a new row on the Netflix homepage with its own unique design that will allow users to see which shows are the most popular on Netflix in their country. This selection will be updated daily, and the position of shows in the row will vary depending on how relevant they are to the user. The Top 10 feature will also be available within the TV shows and movies tabs, allowing users to see the most popular offerings in these categories. “Shows and films that make these lists will also have a special ‘Top 10’ badge, wherever they appear on Netflix,” Netflix said. “That way you can easily see what’s in the zeitgeist, whether you’re browsing by genre or through your personal list – or when searching for specific shows or films.” Netflix has made a number of changes to its platform recently, including the addition of an option to disable autoplay previews on the platform. To turn autoplay previews off, customers can sign in to their Netflix account on a web browser, click the drop-down button to the right of their profile picture, and select Manage Profiles. After selecting their profile, they can uncheck the box next to the “Autoplay previews while browsing on all devices” setting. The streaming service has also begun using a new codec for streaming on its mobile app, which provides 20% better compression efficiency over older standards. This means that videos streamed using this new codec will use less data than before while retaining their quality.
