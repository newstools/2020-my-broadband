Samsung’s next Galaxy Note smartphone could boast a hologram projector and a unique curved display. The details of these components are contained in a patent for a curved display that wraps over the side buttons on a potential future smartphone. The design could be employed in the company’s next Note series, which is expected to be called the Galaxy Note 20. According to the patent, the display will bend more than 90 degrees over the edge of the smartphone, with side controls like the power button and volume rocker protruding from slits in the display. It is not clear if Samsung will opt for this solution or another from a recent patent application which showed touch controls on the side. Notably, the patent further mentions the inclusion of a holographic device and projector built into the display. The patent said the display includes “a panel, a hologram device, and a projector”. “The hologram device uses an interference of light and displays a stereoscopic image in the air,” the patent reads. It described the projector as being able to display an image “by projecting a light beam onto a screen, which may be located inside or outside the electronic device”. The picture below is from the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) and shows the design of the display. <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-339412" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Samsung-curved-display-patent.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="321" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Samsung-curved-display-patent.jpg 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Samsung-curved-display-patent-600x301.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" />
