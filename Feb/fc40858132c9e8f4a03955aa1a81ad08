South Africa’s state-owned companies are in bad shape, with Eskom facing years of load-shedding to keep the national grid alive and SAA embroiled in a painful business rescue process. The state-owned airline was recently forced to cut a large number of flight routes to international and domestic locations in an effort to reduce costs. Both companies have a number of common problems, including a bloated workforce, historical corruption, and gross mismanagement. A trait which they noticeably do not share with successful South African businesses is stable and reliable leadership. The massive churn rate at Eskom and South African Airways is indicative of their mismanagement and failure to perform. In contrast, South African companies which thrive despite a competitive market and regulatory challenges have kept their strong leadership installed for many years. We compared the CEOs of SAA and Eskom over the past five years with those of Vodacom and FNB to demonstrate the leadership crisis at state-owned enterprises. It is important to consider not only the frequency of CEO appointments but also the qualifications and experience of the candidates. South African Airways has failed in functioning as a competitive local airline, entering business rescue and cutting flight routes across the board. Its mismanagement is evident in the number of CEOs the company has instated over the last five years, with only Musa Zwane and Vuyani Jarana occupying the office for more than one year. A number of these CEOs also do not have relevant qualifications, as shown below. <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-235930" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Vuyani-Jarana.jpg" alt="Vuyani Jarana" width="640" height="427" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Vuyani-Jarana.jpg 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Vuyani-Jarana-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> Eskom has seen a staggering number of CEOs over the past five years. Some were hastily removed from the position after their iniquity was brought to light, while others resigned due to the pressure of the job. Many of Eskom’s CEOs also did not have any experience with the mechanics of a large power utility. The exception to this rule were appointees like Matshela Koko, who worked his way up the company ladder since being hired as an engineer-in-training 15 years before he was picked as CEO. Regardless of experience or qualifications, lasting a year as Eskom CEO is an almost-impossible feat – which was only accomplished by Brian Molefe. <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-328157" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Andre-de-Ruyter.jpg" alt="Andre de Ruyter" width="640" height="430" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Andre-de-Ruyter.jpg 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Andre-de-Ruyter-595x400.jpg 595w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Andre-de-Ruyter-300x202.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> In stark contrast to the state-owned entities above, Vodacom has had only one CEO over the last seven years – Shameel Joosub. Unlike many appointees at SAA and Eskom, Joosub has extensive experience in his industry and has worked in an executive role at the company for years. Vodacom is the largest mobile network in South Africa in terms of market share and customer base, and produces strong financial results year after year. <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-184150" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Shameel-Joosub.jpg" alt="shameel-joosub" width="640" height="430" /> FNB, one of the most successful consumer banks in the country, has only had one CEO over the past six years – Jacques Celliers. Celliers is an experienced and qualified executive who has helped to grow the bank’s offering through both traditional and digital channels. FNB offers some of the best consumer banking functionality in the country and has seen great financial success. <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-260341" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/FNB-CEO-Jacques-Celliers.jpg" alt="FNB CEO Jacques Celliers" width="640" height="430" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/FNB-CEO-Jacques-Celliers.jpg 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/FNB-CEO-Jacques-Celliers-300x202.jpg 300w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/FNB-CEO-Jacques-Celliers-595x400.jpg 595w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" />
