Telkom has apologised to subscribers for the network outage on Friday 7 February by giving them 500MB of free data. The Telkom mobile network outage started early on Friday morning and the downtime impacted subscribers for many hours. Multiple Telkom customers vented their frustration in comments on Downdetector and on social media. “Called Telkom, they have no knowledge that LTE is down, apparently no complaints – USELESS. Lady says restart your router and take the sim card out,” one user said. Telkom said in a message to users on Saturday that it has “restored the network outage that affected services on Friday, 7 Feb 2020”. “We are very sorry for any inconvenience caused and have loaded 500MB data so you can say sorry, thank you or I love you to the one you missed. This is valid for 1 day only,” Telkom said.
