Telkom users are reporting that they are unable to connect to the operator’s network or use the Internet. The Telkom Downdetector page showed a huge increase in reports since around 11:00. The problems appeared to be affecting mobile users in particular, with complaints from urban areas – including Johannesburg, Pretoria, Durban, and Cape Town – being the most prevalent. Multiple Telkom customers vented their frustration in comments on Downdetector. “Telkom Mobile network down? Both phones have lost sim connection in Cape Town,” one user said. “Called Telkom, they have no knowledge that LTE is down, apparently no complaints – USELESS. Lady says restart your router and take the sim card out. Told her already done four times and it doesn’t work. Oh, she says, and then puts the phone down on me,” another stated. One user claimed that they were unable to make calls, stating that neither the TelkomSA or the TelkomSA-R networks were functional. Telkom did not immediately respond to requests for comment sent by MyBroadband.
