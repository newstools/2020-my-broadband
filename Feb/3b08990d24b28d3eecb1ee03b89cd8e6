2020 will be a great year for fans of both iOS and Android smartphones, with new flagship devices set to launch from Apple, Huawei, and Samsung. With Samsung’s Galaxy Unpacked launch event around the corner and Mobile World Congress set to kick off later this month, new smartphones are expected to begin arriving imminently. Rumours surrounding upcoming launches suggest that consumers should expect flagship smartphones with more RAM, storage, and CPU power than ever before. Upcoming devices should also sport screen designs which maximise the space on the front of the chassis even more than current flagships if previous trends are observed. Camera systems on handsets from all major manufacturers are also expected to improve this year. We’ve listed the best flagship smartphones set to launch this year below: The launch of Samsung’s Galaxy S20 lineup is imminent, and a number of leaks and rumours have surfaced surrounding the upcoming devices as their release date nears. Recent leaks have stated that Samsung will reveal three S20 smartphones this year – the Galaxy S20, S20+, and S20 Ultra. The new Ultra variant will reportedly boast a bigger display than the other two handsets, along with a more advanced primary camera. All the upcoming Galaxy S20 devices are expected to use the Infinity-O display design and feature quad-camera systems. These devices are expected to be unveiled at Samsung’s Galaxy Unpacked event on 11 February 2020. <img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-336222" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Galaxy-S20-Ultra-5G-640x430.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="430" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Galaxy-S20-Ultra-5G-640x430.jpg 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Galaxy-S20-Ultra-5G-595x400.jpg 595w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Galaxy-S20-Ultra-5G-300x202.jpg 300w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Galaxy-S20-Ultra-5G-768x516.jpg 768w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Galaxy-S20-Ultra-5G-1536x1032.jpg 1536w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Galaxy-S20-Ultra-5G-2048x1376.jpg 2048w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Galaxy-S20-Ultra-5G-1200x806.jpg 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> Shortly after Samsung reveals its new lineup of flagship smartphones, Huawei is expected to launch its P40 smartphone range. Huawei smartphones boast impressive camera systems and cutting-edge display designs, and users should expect more of the same from the manufacturer’s upcoming handsets. Leaked photos and specifications suggest that the P40 Pro will be virtually bezel-less and sport a larger camera bump than previous-generation devices. The Huawei P40 Pro is also rumoured to have a five-camera system on the back with up to 10x optical zoom. Based on rumours and previous-generation specifications, users can expect both the P40 and P40 Pro to sport OLED displays with a bezel-less design. The smartphones are expected to run Android, although it is unclear whether they will be able to use Google Mobile Services (GMS) or if they will use Huawei Mobile Services (HMS) instead. Huawei’s P40 smartphone range is expected to launch at the end of March. <img class="aligncenter wp-image-337882" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Huawei-P40-leak.jpg" alt="Huawei P40 leak" width="640" height="642" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Huawei-P40-leak.jpg 1068w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Huawei-P40-leak-399x400.jpg 399w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Huawei-P40-leak-429x430.jpg 429w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Huawei-P40-leak-768x770.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> Apple’s upcoming iPhone devices are only set to launch later in the year, but rumours are already flying. Leaks have suggested that the iPhone 12 could include some of the biggest changes Apple has made to its smartphones in years. Rumours have indicated that the iPhone 12 could develop a “boxier” aesthetic that transitions away from softer contours – much like Apple’s newer iPad and MacBook devices. Apple is also rumoured to be considering a device that has no notch, with the smartphone sporting a larger bezel instead. These devices are also rumoured to boast quad-camera systems, following the industry trend towards more advanced camera arrays. <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-326643" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/iPhone-12-Display-Camera_Headline.png" alt="" width="640" height="427" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/iPhone-12-Display-Camera_Headline.png 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/iPhone-12-Display-Camera_Headline-600x400.png 600w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> Not much is known about Samsung’s Galaxy Note 20, which is slated to launch near the end of 2020. The device should retain the S-Pen, however, which will probably get a few new features. It will also boast more impressive specifications than previous-generation smartphones. Samsung’s Galaxy Note range is aimed at professionals and creators, and subsequently offers a large amount of storage in addition to great battery life and processing power. The Galaxy Note 20 could retain the Infinity-O display, or it could use a notch-eliminating solution such as an under-screen front camera or a mechanical pop-up lens. <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-336784" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Galaxy-Note-10-Lite-2.jpg" alt="Galaxy Note 10 Lite 2" width="640" height="430" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Galaxy-Note-10-Lite-2.jpg 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Galaxy-Note-10-Lite-2-595x400.jpg 595w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Galaxy-Note-10-Lite-2-300x202.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> Huawei will also launch its Mate 40 smartphone near the end of 2020, setting up to compete with the Galaxy Note 20. Not much is known about this device at the moment, but if previous trends continue, it should offer some form of design improvement over the P40 flagship devices. This could take the form of a new camera system or improved internal hardware. It is impossible to predict whether the status of the US trade ban will still be in effect by the end of the year, but if it is, Huawei is expected to launch this smartphone with Android running its own Huawei Mobile Services. <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-320607" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Huawei-mate-30-Pro-1.jpg" alt="Huawei mate 30 Pro 1" width="640" height="430" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Huawei-mate-30-Pro-1.jpg 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Huawei-mate-30-Pro-1-300x202.jpg 300w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Huawei-mate-30-Pro-1-595x400.jpg 595w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" />
