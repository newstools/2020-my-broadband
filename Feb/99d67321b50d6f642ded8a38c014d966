On 23 January, it emerged that Telkom would be offering employees voluntary separation packages as part of its plan to reduce the number of staff at the company. Payouts to staff based on the number of years they had worked at Telkom was part of the offer. Telkom told staff that the cuts will take place in two phases: Telkom went on to provide reasons for the job cuts. In the Consumer division, the cuts are a result of the business evolving away from a traditional copper-based service supplier. It added that its “legacy operating model” is not aligned to “digital/mobile customer requirements”. In the case of Openserve, Telkom said the wholesale division is “seeing continued decline” in its legacy-based technology revenue, with “increased push from both clients and consumers to move towards next-generation technologies”.
