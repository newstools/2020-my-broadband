MyBroadband is giving away prizes worth R5,000 to encourage you to do a speed test and rate the service you receive from your ISP. MyBroadband’s speed test platform allows you to test your Internet connection’s download speed, upload speed, and latency. After the speed test is completed you can also rate your ISP. These ratings are then used to compile monthly and quarterly reports which rank South African Internet service providers. To ensure a neutral testing environment, MyBroadband’s speed test servers are hosted in Teraco’s vendor-neutral data centres. Through NAPAfrica, all network operators present at its peering points are provided with a free 10Gbps connection to MyBroadband’s speed test platform.
