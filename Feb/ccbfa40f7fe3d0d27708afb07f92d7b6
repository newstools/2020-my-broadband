As technology continues to evolve, users expect improved hardware – particularly in the field of storage. SSD technology has become a popular choice due to its increased speeds and efficiency when compared to traditional hard disk drives. Likewise, external storage devices continue to be prevalent in the tech space as a way of transferring and transporting data easily while on the go. These two technologies have converged upon the portable SSD drive – a high-speed portable storage device that offers incredible performance in a portable form factor. Portable SSDs allow you to store your photos, videos, and files without worrying about slow transfer times or risking data loss. The performance gains provided by portable SSDs also mean you can use Windows Backup, macOS Time Machine, Windows Bitlocker to Go, and Apple FileVault, along with third-party endpoint-protection software suites like Symantec and McAfee. This combines to give you a significantly improved computing experience when on the go. The Crucial X8 is a great example of how portable SSDs offer users fantastic speeds and increased reliability in a portable form factor. The Crucial X8 comes in 500GB and 1TB storage sizes, allowing you to store large amounts of data. When it comes to storage devices, few brands can compete with the pedigree of Crucial. It uses high-quality Micron 3D NAND technology, enabling it to offer elite performance and impressive reliability – even when put through the toughest of workloads. Due to its popularity and reputation, support for these devices is efficient and thorough, and you can access a plethora of support resources online. Syntech, the South African distributor of Crucial storage products, provided us with a 1TB Crucial X8 portable SSD to test. The first thing one notices when using the Crucial X8 portable SSD is how efficiently it is designed. It is a small, simple-looking device that can easily fit into your pocket, and does not take up much space on your working surface. I carried the device around in my pocket, and soon forgot it was even there thanks to its thin and small design. This was also due to it being incredibly light – weighing in at under 100g. This sleek form factor, combined with a classy matte finish, also make the X8 an attractive device that will not look out of place when at a meeting or in your office – it fitted in perfectly with the aesthetic of my ThinkPad laptop, for example. The device is also extremely reliable, as the X8 is designed to withstand a variety of punishing situations and conditions. As part of its testing, the X8 faces extreme temperatures, electric shocks, vibrations, and a 2-metre drop – meaning you can rest assured that this device is prepared for extended use without the risk of damage to your files. The Crucial X8 uses a USB-C to USB-C cable, and also includes a USB-C to USB-A adaptor so that you can easily plug the x8 into your USB port. The USB-C to USB-C cable uses USB 3.2 Gen2 technology which is capable of 10Gb/s transfer speeds. It is also backwards compatible with USB 3.2 Gen1, USB 3.1 Gen1, and USB 3.0 – which support speeds of up to 5Gb/s. It is therefore easy to connect the Crucial X8 to a variety of devices including: The SSD is also powered by the USB Bus, which requires a minimum of 5V and 1.5A. We tested the Crucial X8 1TB portable SSD unit that we were provided. It offers transfer speeds of up to 1,050MB/s, making file transfer remarkably quick and efficient. Transferring files to and from the device felt lightning-fast compared to the external devices I usually use, as I witnessed gigabytes of data transferred in seconds – right in front of my eyes. According to Crucial, these speeds mean that the X8 runs up to 1.8x faster than other portable SSDs, or up to 7.5x faster than portable HDDs – a claim which is easy to believe once you’ve tried the portable SSD. With the drive in your hands, it is clear that this is a solid, well-built device, and I have no trouble believing that it is capable of going through this rigorous testing. Crucial is so confident that the X8 offers great performance and high reliability that they offer a 3-year limited warranty on it.
