Samsung smartphone users were startled to receive a mysterious Find My Mobile notification on their device yesterday, with many worrying that their account had been hacked. The notification was pushed to Samsung devices on 20 February and only included the number “1” in its header and text fields. When users tapped the alert to find out more, it cleared itself from the notification queue. Many Samsung smartphone owners were immediately concerned, as using the Find My Mobile service requires access to the device owner’s Samsung account. Find My Mobile allows Samsung owners to remotely access, lock, and monitor the location of their smartphone. It can also be used to remotely back up Samsung Cloud and Pay data or wipe the smartphone’s storage. For this reason, many feared that their account had been compromised and a third party was remotely accessing their device. According to reports on social media, the notification was pushed to Samsung smartphone users around the world. Upon receiving the notification, many users took to social media to voice their concerns, with one user stating that the Find My Mobile app used 20% of his battery after the notification was sent. Three hours after the notification was sent, Samsung’s UK support team stated on Twitter that the notification was sent mistakenly as part of internal testing. “Recently, a notification about ‘Find My Mobile 1’ occurred on a limited number of Galaxy devices,” Samsung said. “This was sent unintentionally during an internal test and there is no effect on your device.” “We apologize for any inconvenience this may have caused our customers.”
