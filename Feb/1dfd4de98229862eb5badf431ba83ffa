Vodacom has warned its suppliers that they must comply with its stringent coronavirus mitigations to prevent contamination from spreading to the company’s employees. In a mail sent out earlier this month that was seen by MyBroadband, the company laid out requirements for all of its suppliers and third-party staff and blocked them from accessing its properties until they comply with these precautions. “Due to the Novel Coronavirus outbreak in China, Vodacom has put measures in place to mitigate exposure to the virus,” the company told suppliers. It said that all suppliers should execute a number of steps “with immediate effect”, including: Vodacom also said that it would implement a soft lock on all supplier staff access immediately until these conditions were met. It added that it would carry out re-certification of all supplier and third-party access once all necessary steps were completed. “Unauthorized access to any of Vodacom’s premises is strictly prohibited,” Vodacom said. MyBroadband reached out to Vodacom for more information on the company’s coronavirus countermeasures, and the company confirmed it has taken precautionary steps against the virus. “As part of our ongoing commitment to making sure we are proactive about the health and safety of our employees, suppliers and all people who work with Vodacom, we have taken a number of precautionary measures to manage the potential situation,” Vodacom said. The mobile operator added that it has set up a dedicated team to monitor the coronavirus threat and had dispensed advice in line with global standards. “We have set up a business continuity process to address matters relating to routine health advice, travel and supply chain.” “We have provided employees with advice in line with the World Health Organisation, and our dedicated team will continue to monitor the situation and advise accordingly.”
