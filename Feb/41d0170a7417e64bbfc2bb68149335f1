An EFF march at Eskom on Friday to protest against load shedding, unbundling the power utility and possible privatization is causing chaos in Sandton. The EFF gathered at Innesfree Park and is making its way to Eskom’s Megawatt Park offices via Grayston Drive, Rivonia Road and Witkoppen Road. EFF secretary-general Marshall Dlamini told Radio 702 that electricity is no longer a luxury but a human right. He added that small businesses are suffering because of load-shedding and that Pravin Gordhan must be fired as he is incompetent. “Load shedding is happening now, we cannot be held ransom of what happened in the past and not do our work, we are doing our work and holding them accountable,” he said. Due to the EFF protest, large coal trucks parked on Bowling and Katherine streets have severely affected traffic in the area. JMPD spokesperson Wayne Minnaar said the disruptions were expected, especially on Grayston Drive, Rivonia Road and Witkoppen Road. He advised commuters to avoid these roads until 15:00 and use alternative routes like Sandton Drive and William Nicol. SABC reported that scuffles broke out at the march [video here], but that the situation has since calmed down. <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-340601" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/EFF3.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="425" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/EFF3.jpg 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/EFF3-600x398.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> <img class="aligncenter wp-image-340607 size-large" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/EFF-March-4-640x406.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="406" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/EFF-March-4-640x406.jpg 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/EFF-March-4-600x380.jpg 600w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/EFF-March-4-768x487.jpg 768w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/EFF-March-4.jpg 800w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> <img class="aligncenter wp-image-340599" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/EFF-March-2.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="436" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/EFF-March-2.jpg 800w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/EFF-March-2-587x400.jpg 587w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/EFF-March-2-631x430.jpg 631w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/EFF-March-2-768x523.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-340585" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/EFF1.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="458" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/EFF1.jpg 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/EFF1-559x400.jpg 559w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/EFF1-601x430.jpg 601w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-340587" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/EFF2.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="477" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/EFF2.jpg 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/EFF2-537x400.jpg 537w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/EFF2-577x430.jpg 577w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-340589" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/EFF-Trucks.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="891" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/EFF-Trucks.jpg 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/EFF-Trucks-287x400.jpg 287w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/EFF-Trucks-309x430.jpg 309w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-340593" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/EFF-Truck-2.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="448" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/EFF-Truck-2.jpg 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/EFF-Truck-2-571x400.jpg 571w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/EFF-Truck-2-614x430.jpg 614w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> <span data-mce-type="bookmark" style="display: inline-block; width: 0px; overflow: hidden; line-height: 0;" class="mce_SELRES_start">﻿</span> <span data-mce-type="bookmark" style="display: inline-block; width: 0px; overflow: hidden; line-height: 0;" class="mce_SELRES_start">﻿</span>
