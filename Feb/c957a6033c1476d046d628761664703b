Many gamers are eagerly anticipating the launch of Sony’s next-generation gaming console – The PlayStation 5. The company has dominated the current generation of consoles with the PS4, selling more than 100 million units since its launch in 2013. That figure is more than double the number of Xbox One consoles Microsoft was able to sell during the same period. Microsoft has revealed the design and details around the hardware of its next-generation device – The Xbox Series X – which is set to be released around the same time as the PlayStation 5. Naturally, many are waiting to hear more about what Sony will bring to take on Microsoft in the next round of the console wars. In recent months, several new details have been revealed about the PlayStation 5, both in the form of official information and leaks. Here is a summary of what to expect from the Sony PlayStation 5 in 2020. Few specific technical details have been revealed about the hardware that will power the PlayStation 5, but Sony has confirmed that it will have several powerful components. Among these is a third-generation AMD Ryzen octa-core processor, which is built on AMD’s 7nm Zen 2 architecture. This CPU will be paired with a custom AMD Radeon Navi GPU, capable of delivering 8K gaming and ray-tracing support. For storage, Sony has confirmed the console will ship with a solid-state drive, which will offer 10-times faster loading speed for complex scenes. Additionally, the PlayStation 5 will have a drive for physical game discs. Other known features include backwards compatibility with PS4 titles, support for VR gaming, and optimisation for cloud game streaming. <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-257451" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/AMD-Ryzen-2400GE.jpg" alt="AMD Ryzen 2400GE" width="640" height="430" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/AMD-Ryzen-2400GE.jpg 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/AMD-Ryzen-2400GE-300x202.jpg 300w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/AMD-Ryzen-2400GE-595x400.jpg 595w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> The look and external features of the PlayStation 5 are still a mystery. Back in August 2019, Several 3D renders which reportedly showed the design of the PlayStation 5 were published by LetsGoDigital. The unique shape of the console is interesting, but this machine is reportedly only the development kit version of the console. The render is shown below. <img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-317673" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/PlayStation-5-v2-640x420.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="420" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/PlayStation-5-v2-640x420.jpg 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/PlayStation-5-v2-600x394.jpg 600w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/PlayStation-5-v2.jpg 650w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> Although it has not revealed the design of the console’s DualShock 5 controllers, the company has said it will introduce haptic feedback in the new gamepads. This will replace the standard “rumble” functionality to deliver a wider range of vibrations and enhanced immersion. Additionally, developers will be able to set the resistance on the controllers’ triggers based on in-game events. In terms of the controller’s design, images filed with the Japanese Patent Office indicate that it’s likely little change will be made compared to the previous-generation controller. <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-328181" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/ps5.png" alt="ps5" width="640" height="431" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/ps5.png 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/ps5-594x400.png 594w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/ps5-300x202.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> Despite no official confirmation of titles coming to the PlayStation 5 in particular, a number of next-generation games are expected to be available on the console. These include the following titles: <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-263973" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Cyberpunk.jpg" alt="Cyberpunk" width="640" height="430" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Cyberpunk.jpg 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Cyberpunk-300x202.jpg 300w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Cyberpunk-595x400.jpg 595w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> Recent reports have indicated that Sony is struggling with a shortage of parts – in particular RAM and flash memory – which has driven the production cost per unit for the PlayStation 5 to $450 (R6,700). Based on estimates by IHS Markit, the company’s current-generation premium console – The PlayStation 4 Pro – costs about $381 to manufacture. Given the PS4 Pro’s retail price of $400, if Sony plans on selling the PS5 at around the $20 margin, the console could be priced at no less than $470. Other rumours have suggested that the company will follow the established convention of its current generation and offer a Pro variant of the PlayStation 5. This time, however, the more powerful machine may be launched alongside the base model instead of a few years later. Reports speculate that the Pro edition will be $150 more expensive than the standard PlayStation 5. It is not yet clear what will set the two consoles apart. Sony Interactive Entertainment CEO Jim Ryan confirmed that the PlayStation 5 will be released in the holiday 2020 period – somewhere between October and December. An exact launch date is yet to be confirmed, and the console will likely only be available in South Africa several months later.
