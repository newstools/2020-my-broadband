Coca-Cola Beverages South Africa (CCBSA) has launched a 2L bottle made of PET plastic (Polyethylene Terephthalate) along with a programme that allows consumers to earn money back for returning the bottle. PET plastic is a widely-used thermoplastic polymer which is known for its mechanical, thermal, and chemical resistance and its dimensional stability. PET is also one of the most-recycled thermoplastics and has the number “1” as its recycling symbol. Recycled PET can be converted to fibres, fabrics, sheets for packaging, and manufacturing automotive parts. This means the new PET plastic Coca-Cola bottles can be reused up to 14 times, after which it can be recycled and made into new bottles. Apart from the benefit to the environment by cutting down on plastic waste, the new bottles also save consumers money. The recommended retail price for a 2L Coca-Cola Original Taste Less Sugar product is R24, but this drops to R15 when the bottle is returned. Coca-Cola No Sugar, Sprite, and Fanta are also be available in the new 2L returnable PET plastic bottle at a recommended retail price of R12 excluding the R9 deposit. The returnable Coca-Cola bottles are labelled with a new paper label which has “RETURNABLE” stamped in green text on the front. The rollout of the new 2L returnable bottles is being piloted in the Mandela Bay and Border-Kei districts in the Eastern Cape. If this pilot is successful, the new 2L returnable PET plastic bottles will be rolled out to the rest of the country. “We are providing consumers with greater value for money, whilst introducing a PET plastic bottle that can be reused,” says Velaphi Ratshefola, Managing Director of CCBSA. “We’re committed to increasing recycled material in our packaging and ensuring more packaging is collected and recycled,” Ratshefola added.
