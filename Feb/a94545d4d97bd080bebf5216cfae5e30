Microsoft’s Windows 10X operating system will include two different file management interfaces, according to a report from Softpedia News. This version of the Windows 10 operating system is designed for dual-screen and foldable devices such as the Microsoft Surface Neo and Lenovo ThinkPad X1 Fold. The first file explorer is the classic version that most Windows users would be familiar with. This manager is used for navigating and executing Win32 programs. The second interface is a new file explorer for UWP (Universal Windows Platform) apps, which are downloaded from the Microsoft Store. The UWP explorer employs large icons and fonts to make it easier to navigate through a touch interface. For example, long-pressing on a file will bring up a basic context menu with options to delete, cut, copy, share, rename, and view properties. Additionally, users can move files around by dragging and dropping them. It also supports dark mode, and will automatically switch to this theme if it is selected in the Windows 10X settings. Softpedia News described the overall look of the UWP explorer to be “just like a modern app.” According to Microsoft’s typical release schedule, Windows 10X is expected to ship with compatible devices in April or May 2020.
