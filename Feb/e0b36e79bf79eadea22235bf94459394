Huawei CEO Richard Yu has confirmed that the company’s P40 smartphone range will launch on 26 March in Paris, reports GSMArena. Yu was speaking at the global launch event of the company’s foldable Mate Xs smartphone. The Huawei P40 lineup is set to compete with the top devices from Apple and Samsung and is expected to comprise three devices – the P40, P40 Pro, and P40 Lite. Yu did not provide any further details about the devices. Huawei South Africa CBG VP Likun Zhao and Huawei South Africa CTO Akhram Mohamed told MyBroadband that the range would be available in South Africa. “The next flagship devices are coming to South Africa,” Zhao said. “The only difference will be that the new flagships will launch in South Africa without Google Mobile Services (GMS) and with Huawei Mobile Services (HMS) instead.” HMS is not the implementation of Huawei’s Harmony OS operating system; it is a replacement for Google Mobile Services, which enables certain Google services and integrated features. This means that while users will be able to access Google services like Gmail, YouTube, and Chrome, they will not be able to access them through the traditional, pre-loaded apps that usually come with Android devices. Instead, Huawei has implemented its own software to allow users to access these services. “The menus, settings, etc., will all look and feel the same,” Mohamed said. “Over and above that, HMS is the replacement of core services for GMS. A consumer does not engage on core services level, they engage on an app level.” The GSMArena report indicated that the P40 Premium Edition will boast a five-lens camera system, including a 10x optical zoom periscope telephoto lens and a 52MP primary lens. All three models are set to offer Wi-Fi 6+ connectivity – capable, in theory, of reaching speeds of 1,200 Mbps. The P40 range will also reportedly offer dual-mode 5G connectivity across the board.
