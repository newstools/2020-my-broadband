Unbeknownst to many South Africans, any citizen between the age of 8 and 24 can get the Microsoft Office 365 suite and 5TB OneDrive cloud-based storage free of charge through the Mahala.ms portal. The Mahala.ms portal is a partnership between Microsoft South Africa, Penquin, Lava Lamp Lab, and NBConsult that was first launched in May 2017. The objective of the service is to enable learners from grade R to 12 to become more productive and better prepared for the next phase of their academic careers or the workplace. Through the Mahala.ms service, users can activate free Microsoft licenses for all their devices, including their PC, Mac, mobile phone, or tablet. The free Microsoft Office 365 suite includes Word, PowerPoint, OneNote, Outlook, and Excel as well as free OneDrive online storage. Microsoft South Africa’s Lionel Moyal said the Mahala.ms portal holds the potential to change the fortunes of millions of young South Africans by giving them access to Office 365.
