Point Topic’s Q4 2019 residential broadband tariffs report revealed that South Africa has the most unequal broadband prices in the world. Point Topic’s residential broadband report compared the entry-level, median, and average residential broadband tariffs in 83 countries. The report looked at the average prices of copper (DSL), cable, and fibre broadband services, and covered both standalone and bundled services. To ensure like-for-like comparisons, Point Topic used purchasing power parity (PPP) data to compare broadband prices between countries. The report revealed that Ukraine, Russia, and Japan have the most affordable broadband services in the world. On the other end of the scale Qatar, Mauritania, and Bahrain have the most expensive fixed broadband products. The report showed that South Africa has the fifth most affordable entry-level broadband products among the countries surveyed. The country’s median and average fixed-broadband prices, however, are far more expensive. The country ranked 69th and 67th in these two categories respectively. This big difference between entry-level and average broadband prices resulted in South Africa having the most unequal broadband prices in the world. South Africa’s broadband pricing variance – which shows the difference in entry-level and average broadband prices – was 1,324. This is much higher than most other countries, which had a broadband pricing variance of between 0 and 100. Point Topic’s broadband tariff country scorecard is shown below, with the countries at the top of the chart offering the best median tariffs. <img class="aligncenter wp-image-338606" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Broadband-prices.png" alt="" width="640" height="1393" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Broadband-prices.png 942w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Broadband-prices-184x400.png 184w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Broadband-prices-198x430.png 198w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Broadband-prices-768x1671.png 768w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Broadband-prices-706x1536.png 706w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Broadband-prices-941x2048.png 941w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" />
