The Samsung Galaxy Note 10 Lite is set to go on sale in South Africa during the first week of February at a recommended retail price of R12,999. “Lite” devices like this give you the option to buy a cheaper phone with the promise that you get a similar experience to the high-end device it shares a name with. You might expect these devices to be based on the same technology as their flagship counterparts, albeit with some features removed to bring down the price. In reality, “lite” phones often use much older technology. Specifically, the Galaxy Note 10 Lite uses the same processor as Samsung’s flagship devices from last year. Going from a Galaxy Note 9 to a Note 10 Lite is therefore not an upgrade, but more of a “sidegrade”. You would lose dust and water resistance, but gain the extra camera lens on the back and the ultrasonic fingerprint reader. Besides the older processor, there are several differences between the Note 10 Lite and the flagship Note 10 models. The following table summarises those differences. One major deviation not shown in the table is that the Note 10 Lite has a headphone jack, while Samsung has removed the headphone jack from the Note 10 and Note 10+. <img class="wp-image-333932 size-large" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Samsung-Note-10-Lite-copy-640x426.jpg" alt="Stock shot of the Samsung Galaxy Note 10 Lite" width="640" height="426" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Samsung-Note-10-Lite-copy-640x426.jpg 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Samsung-Note-10-Lite-copy-600x400.jpg 600w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Samsung-Note-10-Lite-copy-768x511.jpg 768w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Samsung-Note-10-Lite-copy.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> <img class="wp-image-315835 size-large" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Galaxy-Note-10-Lifestyle-2-640x360.jpg" alt="Galaxy Note 10 Lifestyle (2)" width="640" height="360" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Galaxy-Note-10-Lifestyle-2-640x360.jpg 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Galaxy-Note-10-Lifestyle-2-600x338.jpg 600w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Galaxy-Note-10-Lifestyle-2-768x432.jpg 768w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Galaxy-Note-10-Lifestyle-2-1200x675.jpg 1200w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Galaxy-Note-10-Lifestyle-2.jpg 1920w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" />
