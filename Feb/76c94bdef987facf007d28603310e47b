Digital tools have enabled creativity for generations and Adobe has been at the forefront of innovation with creative tools like Photoshop and Premiere Pro. Recently, Adobe has started to leverage the power of Artificial Intelligence (AI) into tools like Adobe Stock, to create end-to-end experiences and workflows that help creatives tell stories. With a growing catalogue of images, videos, templates and 3D objects, Adobe Stock is a valuable resource for content creators who need to source assets quickly and affordably. By integrating their AI-assistant – Adobe Sensei into Adobe Stock it’s become easy to consistently categorise, label and search for stock images – and when your stock asset library is over 150 million assets strong, that results in significant time savings for designers. Adobe’s AI and machine learning technology also powers Stock’s search and filter functions helping designers find the right content, faster – giving them more freedom to experiment and create seamlessly. <span data-mce-type="bookmark" style="display: inline-block; width: 0px; overflow: hidden; line-height: 0;" class="mce_SELRES_start">﻿</span> “Adobe Stock is a fantastic tool for designers so that they’re not starting from scratch,” says Megan Morahan, Global Creative Director of Product Design at Vistaprint. “When we start from high-quality stock images, we can deliver better designs on a short deadline for our customers.” Adobe says one of the main goals of this integration was to ensure that content search and discovery will always be relevant and efficient. AI-enabled, innovative search categories now that make a reality. If that isn’t enough to solidify Adobe Stock as a tool for empowering creatives, Adobe has taken it a step further by streamlining the way creatives work with stock images. Creators can not only source and work with stock content from inside Adobe’s Creative Cloud apps, but they can also crop and adjust images to ensure the perfect fit, before licensing them from inside the apps they are working from. <img class="aligncenter wp-image-340525 size-large" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Picture1-5-640x421.png" alt="" width="640" height="421" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Picture1-5-640x421.png 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Picture1-5-600x395.png 600w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Picture1-5-768x505.png 768w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Picture1-5.png 956w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> Streamlined workflows like this are a designer’s dream, allowing them time to focus on creating without time and resource limitations.
