Vumatel has announced that it has expanded its fibre coverage to Soweto, where it will offer its prepaid Vuma Reach fibre deal to residents. This product is specifically designed and aimed at bringing affordable, reliable fibre internet to townships. “As one of the nation’s fastest-growing urban residential areas, Soweto and its residents have long been at the top of Vuma’s list to receive access to the Vuma Fibre Reach product,” the company said. Vuma Reach is available to residents on a prepaid basis from Internet service providers (ISPs), which means that residents won’t be tied into a contract. “Fibre is revolutionising the way South Africans do things,” said Vumatel CEO Dietlof Mare. “As the country is transitioning from ADSL to fibre internet, people are experiencing abundant internet access with unlimited connectivity in the comfort of their homes.” “Fibre is faster and more reliable than other Internet services, it enables seamless Internet connectivity that changes the way people connect with each other and to the world,” said Mare. This Vuma Reach fibre package is currently offered through two ISPs – Webafrica and Supersonic – and is priced at R399 per month. The service offers download and upload speeds of 20Mbps and 10Mbps respectively with no fair usage policy.
