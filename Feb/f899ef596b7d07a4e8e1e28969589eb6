AMD’s recently-unveiled Ryzen Threadripper 3990X processor has outperformed one of Intel’s top Xeon Platinum processors, according to benchmarks spotted by Overclockers.ru. The 3990X was unveiled at CES 2020 and is AMD’s flagship offering for high-end workstation requirements. The processor boasts 64 physical cores, 128-threads, a 2.9GHz base clock, 4.3GHz boost clock, and 256MB of L3 cache. It is built on AMD’s 7nm Zen 2 architecture. The benchmark scores were discovered in a SiSoftware SANDRA database entry, with the processor boasting a processor arithmetic score of 1,786.22 giga operations per second (GOPS). The clock speed shown was 4.35GHz, which indicates that the processor may have been overclocked during this test. The scores show that it performed around 18% faster than two 2nd-generation Intel Xeon Platinum 8280 processors, which achieved 1,516.38 GOPS. The high-performance Intel Xeon Platinum 8280 features 28 cores, 56 threads, a base clock speed of 2.7GHz and a boost clock running at 4.0GHz, with 38.5MB L3 cache. A direct comparison between the specs of the two CPUs would show that the Threadripper has an advantage in both core count and thread numbers, but the pricing differences could be a major factor. A single Xeon Platinum processor is priced at $10,000 (R148,200), and while the 3990X’s price has not been revealed, analysts expect it to be much more affordable than Intel’s product. Predictions have put the expected price of the 3990X between $2,999 (R44,450) and $3,999 (R59,265).
