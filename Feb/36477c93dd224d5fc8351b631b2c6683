According to usage statistics provided by W3Techs, WordPress powers over 35% of websites on the Internet and is by far the most popular content management system (CMS). The latest data from the 1st of January 2020 shows WordPress has a CMS market share of over 62%, sitting way ahead of other popular systems like Joomla, Shopify and Drupal. WordPress is constantly evolving with improvements taking place all the time. Recent highlights include the sometimes controversial block based editor code named Gutenberg and the release of Google Site Kit, an official WordPress plugin that helps website owners to stay on top of their game. According to Search Engine Land, page load time and crawl budget rank will be the most important SEO factors in 2020. Google also now includes an experimental page speed feature in Google Search Console meaning webmasters have easy access to current and historical load times. Although end users have been installing cache plugins to speed up WordPress for years, a little-known fact is that caching should also be enabled on the server side. Most web designers are familiar with Apache and its faster competitor NGinx, but there is another web server called LiteSpeed which has both a client-side cache and server-side technology built especially for WordPress. In this world where the ideal loading time for a website is 2 to 5 seconds, getting the entire ecosystem correct is critical. <img class="size-large wp-image-340075 aligncenter" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/With-Keep-Alive-640x430.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="430" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/With-Keep-Alive.jpg 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/With-Keep-Alive-595x400.jpg 595w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/With-Keep-Alive-300x202.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> Vander Host, a company founded by the original founders of Snowball, offers cPanel based WordPress hosting and the LSCache plugin for all WordPress websites.
