Motorola announced two new smartphones as part of its celebration of 100 million global Moto G sales. The first – the Moto G Stylus – could be seen as a rival for Samsung’s recently-unveiled Galaxy Note 10 Lite. It is intended for productivity-focused users and comes with a stylus that is stored in its chassis. It features a triple-camera system with a 48MP main sensor that employs Quad Pixel technology. A 16MP ultra-wide camera provides a four-times larger field of view, while the 2MP depth sensor provides five-times zoom. The device is powered by a Qualcomm Snapdragon 665 octa-core processor with 4GB RAM and offers 128GB of internal storage which can be expanded by up to 512GB with a microSD card. The other new entry – the Moto G Power – is made for power-intensive users and packs a 5,000mAh battery which the company claims can last up to three days on a single charge. It claimed the battery will easily last for 150 hours of music streaming or up to 27 hours of video streaming. Like the Moto G Stylus, it comes with a Snapdragon 665 processor combined with 4GB of RAM, but scales the internal storage down to 64GB. The Moto G Stylus and Moto G Power will be available in the US and Canada at $299.99 (R4,500) and at $249.99 (R3,700), respectively. The specifications and photos of the new Moto G smartphones are shown below. <img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-338110" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Moto-g-stylus-640x430.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="430" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Moto-g-stylus.jpg 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Moto-g-stylus-595x400.jpg 595w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Moto-g-stylus-300x202.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> <img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-338112" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Moto-g-power-640x430.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="430" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Moto-g-power.jpg 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Moto-g-power-595x400.jpg 595w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Moto-g-power-300x202.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" />
