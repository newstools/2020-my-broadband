SensePost – part of Orange Cyberdefense – is celebrating its 20th birthday this month and looks back on its growth over the last two decades. SensePost was first founded by Roelof Temmingh and Charl van der Walt in a bedroom in Centurion, Pretoria on Valentine’s Day of the year 2000. Since then, SensePost has become well-known for its expertise and innovation on the frontlines of cybersecurity. With team members that include some of the world’s most preeminent cybersecurity experts, SensePost has helped governments and blue-chip companies review and protect their information security and stay ahead of evolving threats. <img class="size-large wp-image-338920 aligncenter" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Picture1-4-640x427.png" alt="" width="640" height="427" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Picture1-4-640x427.png 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Picture1-4-600x400.png 600w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Picture1-4-768x512.png 768w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Picture1-4.png 975w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> This year, Jaco van Graan – the CEO of SensePost for the last seven years, and one of the first employees – has been promoted to grow Orange Cyberdefense’s (OCD) services into the Middle East and US markets. He will however remain on the SensePost board as Chairman. Dominic White, who has been the CTO of SensePost for the last seven years, will take over van Graan’s role as the new CEO globally. Co-founder of SensePost, Charl van der Walt, has been promoted to the Head of Security Research for OCD and will also remain on the SP board. Further promotions include one of SensePost’s senior researchers Leon Jacobs – who will be SensePost’s new CTO – and Andre van der Walt, SensePost’s current COO, who will take on an expanded global COO role. According to White, these promotions are the result of the positives of having been acquired by Orange Cyber Defence in 2019. “Traditionally, these sorts of promotions come in the wake of employees leaving the business; instead, the acquisition has allowed us to provide people with new opportunities,” said White. Last year, Orange Cyberdefense announced the acquisition of SensePost. This next chapter for SensePost will see collaboration with numerous other European penetration testing teams in the group, making Orange Cyberdefense one of the largest penetration testing teams in Europe, the UK, and South Africa.
