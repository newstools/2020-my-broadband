Google Maps has announced a list of the most popular locations in South Africa. As part of its 15th anniversary, the world’s top navigation app revealed its users’ most highly-rated restaurants, bars and tourist locations in and around Johannesburg and Cape Town. “South Africa has an abundance of places to eat, drink and be merry. Tourists flock to our country because there’s so much to see and do, and our exchange rate is favourable for most,” Google South Africa said.
