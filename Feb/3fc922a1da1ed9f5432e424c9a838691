Intel could be working on a high-performance graphics card to rival the likes of Nvidia’s top-end GeForce RTX 2080 Ti. This is according to a report from Digital Trends, which claimed to have documents from an internal presentation detailing Intel’s plans for its Xe graphics architecture in early 2019. The documents noted a GPU with a thermal design power (TDP) of 500W, more than any other current graphics card pulls. The high TDP could be an indication that the card boasts impressive hardware specifications. Currently, the RTX 2080 Ti offers the best performance of any mainstream consumer card and uses only 250W. A chart from the documents outlines the architecture setup and power specifications of seven different cards, with the 500W variant at the top of the range. The other cards are rated at TDPs of 75W, 150W, and 300W. Intel is expected to use “tile” modules as a part of its architecture. The company said in November 2019 that Xe will employ a multi-die system packaged with Foveros 3D stacking. Digital Trends speculated the technique could be similar to what AMD does in its Zen processors. Intel previously showcased a GPU which uses the Xe architecture – the DG1 – at CES 2020. Although it did not disclose information on clock speeds, GPU core count, VRAM, or other technical specifications, the company showed the card running Warframe and Destiny 2 in 1080p at 60fps. The card has been sent to developers to optimise their games and other software for compatibility with the GPU.
