A video has surfaced online of a brazen robbery targeting a Matrix Warehouse store in Bellville, Cape Town. The video was recorded on a bystander’s smartphone and shows a pair of men taking merchandise from the Matrix Warehouse store and loading it into a vehicle. Unperturbed by bystanders and other drivers in the parking lot, the suspects continue to run between the store and the vehicle, taking goods from the retailer. The men eventually flee with their stolen merchandise when another vehicle approaches, leaving the scene in both a bakkie and a BMW sedan. MyBroadband reached out to Matrix Warehouse for comment on the video, and the company confirmed that its Bellville branch suffered a robbery. “The police are busy with the investigation, so at this point in time, we are not allowed to disclose any information,” Matrix Warehouse said. Watch the full video below:  Minister of Police Bheki Cele recently said that retail businesses in South Africa operate in a danger zone, with robberies occurring every day. Retailers are especially targeted by criminals, and despite the slight decrease in armed robberies over the last year, businesses are still suffering. The increased cost of private security to deter and combat armed robberies has also severely impacted many local businesses. The danger of retail crime was demonstrated by a spate of mall robberies at the end of 2019, with malls in both Johannesburg and Cape Town being targeted. These robberies are often violent and commonly end either in shootouts with law enforcement or the escape of the perpetrators. According to the latest crime statistics, common robbery, robbery with aggravating circumstances, and commercial crime all increased compared to the previous year. A total of 2.01 million crimes were recorded in 2019 – down from the 2.09 million recorded in 2018.
