A new leak has revealed the specifications of Intel’s 10th-generation Comet Lake F-series desktop processors, according to a report from Tom’s Hardware. The information comes from a PowerPoint slide acquired by Uruguayan site Informática Cero that purportedly shows part of a presentation regarding the new processors. The first F-series chips were introduced in Intel’s 9th-generation Coffee Lake processors. These chips use the same silicon as non-F-series processors but do not include integrated graphics. The leak shows that the company will launch two power variants of each of the processors – three KF processors with a thermal design power of 125W and three F versions with 65W. Both versions of the Core i9, i7, and i5 processors share the same number of cores and threads, but different clock speeds. The i9-10900KF and i9-10900F will come with 10 cores and 20 threads each, with 20MB of Intel Smart Cache. The KF version boasts a base clock speed of 3.7GHz, while the F variant runs at 2.8GHz. Intel’s 10th-gen Core i9 processors support Thermal Velocity Boost (TVB), which means the KF processor can reach a clock speed of up to 5.3GHz, with the F edition capable of going up to 5.2GHz. The i7-10700KF and i7-10700F boast 8 cores and 16 threads and base clock speeds of 3.8GHz and 2.9GHz, respectively. The i5-10600KF and i5-10600F have 6 cores and 12 threads, with 12MB cache. Base clock speeds are 4.1GHz for the KF processor and 2.9GHz for the F version. All six processors feature Intel Single Core Turbo Boost capabilities, which is indicated as the boost clock speed in the table below. Intel has fallen behind the curve when it comes to chip architecture development. While these processors are based on a 14nm manufacturing process, Intel’s biggest rival – AMD – has launched several processors that employ its 7nm Zen 2 architecture. AMD’s Ryzen 3000 series has performed well in particular, with impressive sale figures nearly double that of Intel’s offering in certain regions. The pressure has lead to Intel bringing down the prices of its 10th-generation Cascade Lake-X CPUs to counter AMD’s Threadripper 3000 series launch. Further reports speculate that the company may do this again in the second half of 2020 to fight AMD’s Zen 3 processors, which are expected to launch near the end of 2020. Intel’s Comet Lake processors are expected to launch in April 2020. The table below shows the specifications of the leaked Comet Lake F-series processors.
