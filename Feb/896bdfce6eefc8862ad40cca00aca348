Samsung recently announced several new mid-range smartphones, including the Galaxy S10 Lite. No recommended pricing or launch window has been announced for this device in South Africa yet, but if prices from elsewhere in the world are any indication, the Galaxy S10 Lite will likely be a few hundred rand more expensive than the Note 10 Lite. The Note 10 Lite is set to launch in South Africa during the first week of February at a recommended retail price of R12,999. Both the S10 Lite and Note 10 Lite are on the expensive side of the mid-range scale but are also more affordable than the flagship devices they share their names with. Smartphone makers like Samsung and Huawei have been marketing “mini” and “lite” versions of their flagship devices for as long as they have been making Android smartphones. These “lite” devices give you the option to buy a cheaper phone, with the promise that you get one that gives a similar experience to the high-end device it gets its name from. You might expect these devices to be based on the same technology as their flagship counterparts, albeit with some features removed to bring down the price. However, “lite” phones often use much older technology. Even the Galaxy Note 10 Lite uses the processor that Samsung used in last year’s Galaxy Note 9. The Galaxy S10 Lite is a different story, however. Initial indications are that it will use a Qualcomm Snapdragon 855 chipset — the same chip Samsung used for the Galaxy S10 and S10+ in the US and China. It also comes with a bigger battery than either of its flagship counterparts. Sammobile suggests that the Galaxy S10 Lite made cuts in several places to bring its price down: it has a single loudspeaker, doesn’t have a headphone jack, and has a macro camera instead of a telephoto camera. The table below summarises the differences between the Samsung Galaxy S10, Galaxy S10+, and the Galaxy S10 Lite. <img class="wp-image-333926 size-large aligncenter" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Samsung-S10-Lite-640x426.jpg" alt="Stock photo of the Samsung Galaxy S10 Lite" width="640" height="426" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Samsung-S10-Lite-640x426.jpg 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Samsung-S10-Lite-600x400.jpg 600w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Samsung-S10-Lite-768x511.jpg 768w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Samsung-S10-Lite.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> <img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-337306" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Galaxy-S10-front-640x430.jpg" alt="Galaxy S10 front" width="640" height="430" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Galaxy-S10-front.jpg 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Galaxy-S10-front-595x400.jpg 595w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Galaxy-S10-front-300x202.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> <img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-297322" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Galaxy-S10-640x427.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="427" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Galaxy-S10-640x427.jpg 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Galaxy-S10-600x400.jpg 600w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Galaxy-S10-768x512.jpg 768w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Galaxy-S10.jpg 900w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" />
