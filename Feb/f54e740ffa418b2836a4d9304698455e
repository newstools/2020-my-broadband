Openserve – Telkom’s wholesale and networks division – confirmed that it has restored all services that were affected by a network outage that took place on 25 February. “Voice service in the country was impacted owing to a multi-faceted fault condition that occurred on Openserve’s voice platform on 25 February,” said Openserve. “Members of the public who would have attempted dialling SmartAccess (largely 0800/0860/0861/0862) numbers were sometimes not able to establish a connection but will be able to now as services have returned to normal functionality.” Openserve said the process of fixing the issue was challenging as it involved a variety of complex actions that had been conducted both on the physical and logical layers of the voice platform. “The Openserve Centre Operations team worked tirelessly with its platform vendor’s local and international experts to assist with repair,” said Openserve. It said it found that the hardware on some infrastructure elements was the cause of the breakdown. This hardware has been replaced and software configurations have been restored. “Openserve and its vendor support team remain on high alert and continue monitoring to ensure that the platform remains stable,” said Openserve. On 25 February, many companies reported that their call centres, which operate in the toll-free number range, were unreachable. Businesses affected included Discovery, Standard Bank, and Xneelo. An industry source told MyBroadband that all of Telkom’s interconnections with other licensees were affected by the outage. They said that calls from Telkom landline numbers were failing but Telkom Mobile was unaffected. According to the source, these problems began on the evening of 24 February and the system recovered the next morning before failing again on 25 February.
