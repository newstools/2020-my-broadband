Zen Citi has launched Smash’d in South Africa – a new mobile app which automatically populates Accident Report Forms (AR Forms) from user-provided input. Smash’d allows users to capture pictures of the accident scene, scan the license disks of the vehicles and driver’s licenses of the parties involved, and input any other information required via the app. Once this is completed, Smash’d generates and emails a completed AR Form to the user for printing. The form can then be handed in and signed in front of a police officer at the relevant police station. The AR Form is a requirement to receive an accident case number, which motor insurance companies need to process claims. Zen Citi managing director Dineshan Chetty said the app is a solution to outdated reporting which can be time-, resource-, and cost-consuming. “The app provides a quick and guided experience to ensure accuracy and efficiency in reporting an accident whilst still being cost-effective for government,” Chetty said. “Smash’d ensures that users are made aware of all necessary information required and guides them through every step in reporting their accident at the scene to avoid wasting time.” The company said the more than 1 million accidents reported each year cost the South African government almost R2 billion to manage. Although the current reporting process on Smash’d still requires the user to visit a police station, Zen Citi said it is working on making the submission fully online. “The goal is to integrate into the eNatis system and move away from reporting processes requiring a lot of resources including printing & paper costs, data capturing and data management,” Chetty stated. The app is currently available for Android and can be downloaded from the Google Play Store, with support for iOS devices coming soon. <img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-337632" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Smashd-app_1-640x430.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="430" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Smashd-app_1.jpeg 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Smashd-app_1-595x400.jpeg 595w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Smashd-app_1-300x202.jpeg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> <img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-337634" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Smashd-app_2-640x430.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="430" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Smashd-app_2.jpeg 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Smashd-app_2-595x400.jpeg 595w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Smashd-app_2-300x202.jpeg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" />
