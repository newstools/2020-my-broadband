A new version of Windows 10 will install updates in a few seconds, according to a report from Softpedia News. The announcement came at Microsoft’s 365 Developer Day and pertains to Windows 10X, Microsoft’s operating system for dual-screen and foldable devices. The Microsoft Surface Neo dual-screen laptop is the first device to use the reworked OS, while Lenovo’s ThinkPad X1 Fold device is another that will ship with Windows 10X in mid-2020. The operating system is expected to be available on more devices made by Microsoft’s partners and other companies. Microsoft explained that Windows 10X will be able to perform updates quickly as it is separated from OS components, including drivers and apps. First off, Windows 10X downloads the feature update during an online stage and once finished, moves it to an offline partition. When the device is restarted, the required information is transferred to the new partition and activated for booting. The new version is started up in less than 90 seconds, Microsoft claimed. Additionally, conventional Win32 desktop programs run in containers, preventing them from making any changes to system files and impacting Windows Update. Though it would be a welcome change, it is not yet clear if this implementation method could launch for the standard version of Windows 10. Currently, updates on Windows 10 take a considerable amount of time, with  big feature updates taking up to four hours to complete.
