SpaceX could carry out its first crewed flight in three months’ time, according to Ars Technica reporter Eric Berger. In a tweet on Monday, Berger said the working date for SpaceX’s Demo-2 launch is 7 May. He noted that the launch date is fluid and the mission could be moved to late April or delayed deeper into May, depending on a number of variables not related to hardware. The mission will see astronauts Doug Hurley and Robert Behnken board SpaceX’s Crew Dragon spacecraft and head to the International Space Station. The expected length of the mission is not yet known. SpaceX has managed several successful unmanned tests of its rockets and spacecraft in recent years. Back in January, SpaceX successfully conducted a major test of its ability to carry astronauts in the Dragon 2 capsule. It performed a successful in-flight launch escape test, proving that the capsule would be able to separate from the Falcon 9 Heavy rocket in the event that the rocket was compromised. Elon Musk previously shared an animated simulation of what the mission could look like.
