The EOH board has announced two changes to its team of non-executive directors. Dr Anushka Bogdanov has been promoted to the position of lead independent non-executive director. This follows the appointment of the former holder of this position, Andrew Mthembu, as board chairman. Bogdanov was already an independent non-executive director on the board and is also currently the chairperson of EOH’s Social and Ethics committee. Bogdanov is also a member of the governance, risk, nomination, and remuneration committees. “The board congratulates Dr Bogdanov on her appointment and looks forward to her ongoing contribution as an instrumental member of the Board,” EOH said. EOH has also added Sipho Ngidi to its board as an independent non-executive director. Ngidi has over 20 years of HR experience across various companies including Nampak, South African Breweries, and Standard Bank. He has also held several board and subcommittee roles, and is currently the chairman of the fibre processing and manufacturing Seta and Ithala SOC Limited boards, as well as the Toyota South Africa board. “EOH will greatly benefit from Mr Ngidi’s specific expertise as the company strives to be a responsible employer, nurturing talent and implementing remuneration policies that support the
long-term business strategy,” said EOH. “The board welcomes Mr Ngidi and is looking forward to his contribution to the Group.”
