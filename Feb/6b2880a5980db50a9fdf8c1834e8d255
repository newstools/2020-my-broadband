President Cyril Ramaphosa revealed in his state of the nation address on Thursday on 13 February that a new smart-city is taking shape in Lanseria, Gauteng. The process is a joint project between the Investment and Infrastructure Office in the Presidency and the Gauteng and North West provincial governments. The cities of Johannesburg, Tshwane, and Madibeng and private partners will also help to make the smart city a reality. Ramaphosa said the new smart-city will be home to between 350,000 and 500,000 people within the next decade. “We have put together an innovative process that will fund the bulk sewerage, electricity, water, digital infrastructure, and roads,” the President said. He added that it will not only be smart and 5G-ready but will also be a leading benchmark for green infrastructure. While Ramaphosa did not share further details in his state of the nation address, a lot of information has previously been shared about the project. The Gauteng government said last year that the ‘Lanseria Airport City Mega Project’ is designed to be a high-density mixed-use residential area. The city’s infrastructure and economy are centred on the airport and are designed to promote “a new city form of cross-cultural living”. The project would create 50,000 residential units and approximately 5 million square metres of commercial floor space. Crosspoint, in cooperation with the Gauteng Department of Human Settlements, will implement the Lanseria Airport City Mega Project over a ten-year period. According to previously-released information, the Lanseria Airport City will feature regional transportation nodes. The Gautrain will extend its route to include the Lanseria airport. The city also aims to be an ICT, training, and research centre complete with tourism and leisure attractions, and become a manufacturing, logistics, and business hub. The Lanseria Airport City will be a green city which will “interface with nature” and is designed for minimal environmental impact. The city will feature rainwater harvesting and solar energy to ensure that it has a very small carbon footprint. “Lanseria Airport City is a green city of growth and opportunity that will enable all to work, play, live and dream,” Crosspoint said. It added that this is the largest and most exciting property development ever seen in South Africa. <img class="aligncenter wp-image-339312 size-large"
