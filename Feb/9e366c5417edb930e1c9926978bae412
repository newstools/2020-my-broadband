Google has announced that it will be expanding the range of smartphones which can run its Stadia game streaming service. Previously, Google’s own Pixel devices were the only smartphones that supported the game streaming service, but the range of devices which will now support Stadia also include Samsung, ASUS, and Razer smartphones. Google said that support for these new mobile devices will arrive later this week. “You’ll also soon be able to play on the brand new Samsung S20 line,” said Google. “More supported phones means you have even more ways to play games when, where, and how you want with Stadia.” The full list of newly-compatible smartphones can be found below: Alongside these supported smartphones, Stadia can be used on tablets, laptops, desktops, and TVs (via Google Chromecast Ultra).
