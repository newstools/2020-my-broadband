Eskom announced that stage 2 load-shedding will continue until Sunday at 06:00 due to a shortage in capacity. This follows Eskom announcing earlier today that load-shedding would be implemented from 09:00 on Thursday until 06:00 on Saturday. “Stage 2 rotational load-shedding will continue today until Sunday at 06:00 owing to the loss of additional units that has increased the shortage in generation capacity,” Eskom said. “Stage 2 load-shedding will be necessary on Saturday to replenish reserves to better prepare for the coming week.” Unplanned outages or breakdowns were at 12,225MW as of Thursday afternoon, Eskom said, with planned maintenance at 4,554MW. “The system remains vulnerable and constrained, and as such we remind customers that any shift in the system performance will require a change in the stage of load-shedding at short notice,” Eskom said. #POWERALERT 2Date: 20 February 2020 Stage 2 rotational loadshedding will continue until Sunday at 06:00 @SABCNewsOnline @eNCA @ewnupdates @IOL @SABCRadio @TheSAnews @TimesLIVE @News24 @SAgovnews pic.twitter.com/WUlkSGOns0 — Eskom Hld SOC Ltd (@Eskom_SA) February 20, 2020  Eskom is also currently engaged in a court battle with Nersa over tariff increases. The North Gauteng High Court recently dismissed Eskom’s urgent application to get R58.5 billion from customers through two big price increases. Eskom wanted the price of electricity to be increased by 16.6% on 1 April 2020, with a further 16.7% price hike on 1 April 2021. Although the court considered the matter not to be urgent, Judge Jody Kollapen said there were merits to Eskom’s case. These will be heard in “part B” of the application, which means that big future tariff increases are still a possibility.
