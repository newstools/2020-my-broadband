MTN has launched its new Traveller Bundles for international visitors to South Africa. “These bundles allow tourists to stay connected with their family, friends and business associates whilst visiting South Africa with a local SIM rather than roaming,” MTN said. The bundles available are 10GB for R449 and 20GB for R799. MTN said that these bundles are exclusive to new prepaid tourists and will be available from selected MTN stores at several of South Africa’s airports – including OR Tambo, King Shaka, and Cape Town International Airport. The bundles are valid for 30 days from the date of activation. To purchase a SIM card, customers are required to present a valid passport and seat number or flight ticket. The table below shows more information on the Traveller bundles. Notably, these prepaid bundles are more affordable than those available to MTN’s South African customers. A local 30-day 10GB bundle is priced at R499, which is R50 more expensive than the bundle offered to tourists. A monthly 20GB bundle is R100 more than its Traveller Bundle equivalent, which is priced at R899. Nevertheless, a recent comparison between the data prices of South Africa’s two biggest operators – Vodacom and MTN – showed that the overall price of data has reduced significantly over the last decade. For example, a 1GB data bundle from MTN now costs R149 compared to R289 in 2010.
