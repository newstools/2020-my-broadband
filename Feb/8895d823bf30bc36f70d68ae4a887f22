Eskom has announced that stage 2 load-shedding will continue until Friday, with a high probability of load-shedding on the weekend. “Eskom regrets that owing to a shortage of capacity and a higher demand of about 2,000MW for electricity, stage 2 rotational load-shedding will continue tomorrow until Friday,” the power utility said. “There is also a high probability of load-shedding during the weekend.” Eskom said that it will communicate with customers regularly over this period. The power utility added that there is an increased possibility of load-shedding over the next 18 months as Eskom is conducting critical maintenance to restore its ageing infrastructure. “We don’t take the decision to implement load-shedding lightly, but the reality is that our generating infrastructure is constrained and unreliable,” said Eskom CEO Andre de Ruyter. “It is regrettable for us to have to implement load-shedding, but it is unavoidable given the state of the generation infrastructure, as well as unusually high demand.” Eskom will continue to try and provide breaks from load-shedding during the morning traffic rush hours during the week, provided the replenishment of its pumped storage schemes and open-cycle gas turbines are sufficient to support this. “We remind customers that suspending load-shedding during the peak hour traffic is a pilot meant to help minimise the impact of load-shedding on the commuting public, and is contingent on the availability of generating capacity and the use of emergency generating units.”
