Google has announced it will start blocking video ads that annoy users across its platforms and in its Chrome browser. The company said it will align its policies with changes to the Better Ads Standards, as developed by the Coalition for Better Ads. The Coalition recently conducted research among 45,000 consumers to determine which advertising experiences irritate users the most. The study found that users found that three types of video ads are particularly disruptive on video content of less than eight minutes long: The Coalition said website owners should stop showing these adverts to visitors in the next four months. Google said it would follow suit for video ads on the Chrome browser. “Following the Coalition’s lead, beginning August 5, 2020, Chrome will expand its user protections and stop showing all ads on sites in any country that repeatedly show these disruptive ads.” Additionally, the company said YouTube will be included in these amendments. “It’s important to note that YouTube.com, like other websites with video content, will be reviewed for compliance with the Standards,” Google stated. “Similar to the previous Better Ads Standards, we’ll update our product plans across our ad platforms, including YouTube, as a result of this standard, and leverage the research as a tool to help guide product development in the future.” The company recommended that website administrators who oversee sites which contain ads review their status in Google’s Ad Experience Report. The tool shows publishers if Chrome has identified any violating ad experiences on their site.
