Samsung unveiled its new Galaxy smartphones at its Unpacked 2020 event in San Francisco. The new device lineup includes the Galaxy S20, S20+, and S20 Ultra, as well as the foldable Galaxy Z Flip. Samsung’s Galaxy Z Flip sports a new form factor, departing from the Galaxy Fold’s vertical folding mechanism for a horizontally-folding clamshell design. The Galaxy S20, S20+, and S20 Ultra all support optional 5G connectivity, with the latter boasting a powerful camera with up to 100x zoom. Samsung also revealed its new Galaxy Buds+ wireless earbuds, which offer greatly improved battery life and enhanced audio compared to the previous generation. Unlike Samsung’s previous Galaxy Fold device, the Galaxy Z Flip sports a clamshell folding design with the main display folding along the horizontal axis. This lends the device a much smaller form factor when closed, where notifications and other information is displayed on a smaller display on the outside of the device. The device’s operating system is optimised for its unique form factor, offering a number of tailored camera and notification features. Samsung’s Galaxy Z Flip is set to launch in South Africa on 22 February 2020 and will be priced at R29,999. The device will also be available on contract from around R1,499 per month.

The Samsung Galaxy S20, S20+, and S20 Ultra offer 6.2-inch, 6.7-inch, and 6.9-inch OLED displays respectively, each with a refresh rate of up to 120Hz. Samsung’s Galaxy S20 Ultra is the flagship of the range, offering a highly-advanced camera system with up to 100x Super Resolution zoom. The smartphones that will initially roll out in South Africa will not offer 5G connectivity, but Samsung Africa CEO Sung Yoon said that a mobile 5G network was expected to launch in South Africa in the next few months and the company was in discussions with mobile operators regarding the launch of 5G devices. Below is a breakdown of the local pricing for Samsung’s new Galaxy S20 smartphones. The devices will be available in South Africa from 6 March 2020. Customers who pre-order or purchase the Galaxy S20+ or Galaxy S20 Ultra before 12 March will qualify for a free pair of Galaxy Buds+ valued at R2,999.
