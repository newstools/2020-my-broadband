WhatsApp will no longer work on millions of smartphones running older versions of Android and iOS. As of 1 February, devices running operating system versions older than Android 2.3.7 or iOS 8 no longer support the Facebook-owned instant messaging platform. Smartphone users running these operating systems will have to update to later versions of their OS to continue using the app or get a new device if no further updates are available for their smartphone. WhatsApp first announced in December 2019 that it would discontinue support for these devices. The company said the move was made to protect users, as these legacy operating systems are no longer served with essential security updates which help protect user data. WhatsApp stated it provides support for and recommends using the following devices: According to the company, a small number of users will be affected, as just 0.3% of Android devices globally run Android 2.3.7 Gingerbread. Many of these devices are in developing countries in Asia and Africa. Additionally, the change will cut off iPhone 4 users, with the latest available operating system on these devices being iOS 7. Owners of the iPhone 4S are safe, for now, as this generation still offers support for iOS 9.
