Samsung’s upcoming foldable smartphone – the Galaxy Z Flip – has been leaked in a video posted to social media. Mobile tech leaker Ben Geskin posted a short clip to Twitter showing the device being flipped open and closed. The video appears to confirm several leaks that have revealed details about the device’s design. It is unclear from the video whether the display is made of ultra-thin glass, however, as claimed in a report from WinFuture last week. Several other supposed specifications of the Z Flip have been recently leaked. This includes a main 6.7-inch OLED display with a resolution of 2,636 x 1,080 and a smaller 1.06-inch 300 x 116 panel on the back. In terms of internal hardware, the Z Flip will reportedly come with a Snapdragon 855+ processor, 8GB RAM, 256GB internal storage, and a 3,300mAh battery. For the Z Flip’s camera, leaks suggest Samsung could opt for for a dual-lens setup on the back consisting of two 12MP sensors, along with a 10MP camera on the front. Samsung is set to unveil the Galaxy Z Flip and Galaxy S20 series at the company’s Unpacked Event on 11 February. The video below is from tech leaker Ben Geskin and shows what appears to be the Galaxy Z Flip in use.
