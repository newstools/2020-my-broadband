An alleged press image posted on Weibo implies that Lenovo will be launching a gaming smartphone that uses Qualcomm’s 865 5G chip. The image shows branding for Qualcomm’s 865 5G chip on a Lenovo Legion-branded image – indicating that Lenovo is likely planning on launching a Legion smartphone that supports 5G. Techradar speculates that the Lenovo device will likely offer other high-end specifications such as improved cooling to maximised the Snapdragon 865’s clock speeds, as well as 120Hz refresh rates. A 5G connection on a gaming smartphone could be a big advantage due to the rise of cloud gaming services – meaning that gamers would be able to stream games on a faster, more stable connection. Lenovo South Africa general manager Thibault Dousson previously told MyBroadband that the gaming market is growing exponentially in South Africa and that the company’s Legion division has had great success. “If I look at the [EMEA] region, it multiplied by four or five times in the last two years,” said Dousson. “So we’ve now positioned a lot of products in the market.” He said that Lenovo is thinking of launching more affordable gaming laptops in South Africa to appeal to a wider market.
