In a recent survey, it was shown that 76 percent of broadband households in North America expressed high levels of concern about security and privacy when using their connected devices. This in part is due to the proliferation of devices connected to the home network, laptops, tablets, and phones which can all have individual security installed, but what about your Smart home devices such as security cameras, printers, and thermostats – not to mention the infamous baby monitors. Many of these Smart home devices offer little to no security protection, which makes them easy targets for hackers. By embedding malware in these devices, hackers can control them remotely and use them in botnets to launch large-scale attacks, such as distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks. Cyber attackers continue to probe and take advantage of security vulnerabilities in consumer home networks. Many home Wi-Fi gateways, especially low-end models, have been found to be vulnerable to a variety of malicious attacks. By deploying a router-based security solution, all devices can be protected using solution that protects all devices equally. For service providers, this represents an opportunity to provide subscribers with a set of easy-to-use tools that protects subscribers and improves their overall experience, while also reducing the number of costly support calls, decreasing churn, and generating additional revenue. <img class="size-large wp-image-338996 aligncenter" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Route-based-security-solution-640x430.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="430" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Route-based-security-solution.jpg 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Route-based-security-solution-595x400.jpg 595w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Route-based-security-solution-300x202.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> One method of offering these capabilities is through a mobile app that enables subscribers to enable security controls and receive notifications and alerts related to network threats. ProtectIQ is a network-level security application that provides malicious website protection, anti-virus and anti-ransomware packet inspection, and intrusion detection. ProtectIQ proactivity monitors network traffic coming into your subscribers’ homes, using a proprietary classification engine that automatically blocks anything that looks suspicious. A container within EXOS – the platform that runs on top of the Calix GigaSpire – provides the ideal location for network security functionality. The GigaSpire is the nexus through which all traffic to the home passes, providing a natural point at which to establish and enforce a home perimeter layer of security and privacy. Subscribers use the CommandIQ mobile app to enable their security controls, receive security-related notifications and alerts, and add trusted devices to a ‘white list’. As cyber attackers continue to target residential gateways, routers and poorly secured IoT devices in subscriber home networks, it’s more important than ever for CSPs to expand the level of security protection they are providing to their subscribers. By implementing a proactive approach to securing subscriber home networks, CSPs can not only protect their own networks from potentially devastating attacks, but also their subscribers.
