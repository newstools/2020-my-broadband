Samsung revealed its new Galaxy Z Flip foldable smartphone at its Unpacked 2020 event in San Francisco. Unlike Samsung’s previous Galaxy Fold device, the Galaxy Z Flip sports a clamshell folding design with the main display folding along the horizontal axis. This lends the device a much smaller form factor when closed, where notifications and other information is displayed on a smaller display on the outside of the device. The device’s operating system is optimised for its unique form factor, offering a number of tailored camera and notification features. Samsung has also implemented its “Infinity Flex Display” technology on its latest foldable smartphone, a significant upgrade from the plastic displays used on the previous-generation Galaxy Fold. “As the world’s first foldable glass smartphone, the Galaxy Z Flip’s revolutionary form factor opens up a whole new world of mobile experiences, and gives you even more options to express yourself,” Samsung said. “Compact and portable when folded, the Galaxy Z Flip features an innovative freestop folding system that enables the device to stay open at a range of angles, giving you a never-before-seen mobile experience.” The device sports a main 6.7-inch OLED display with a resolution of 2,636 x 1,080 and a smaller 1.06-inch 300 x 116 panel on the back. In terms of internal hardware, the Z Flip will ship with a Snapdragon 855+ processor, 8GB of RAM, 256GB of internal storage, and a 3,300mAh battery. The main rear camera features two 12MP lenses – one wide and one ultra-wide. The front of the Z Flip sports a punch-hole 10MP camera with autofocus. The device has a dual battery which delivers a total capacity of 3,300mAh. Samsung said the Galaxy Z Flip would be available in three colours – Mirror Purple, Mirror Black, and Mirror Gold. The Galaxy Z Flip will be priced from $1,380 and will be available on 14 February 2020. <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-338396" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Galaxy-Z-Flip-1.jpg" alt="Galaxy Z Flip 1" width="640" height="430" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Galaxy-Z-Flip-1.jpg 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Galaxy-Z-Flip-1-595x400.jpg 595w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Galaxy-Z-Flip-1-300x202.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> <img class="aligncenter wp-image-338400" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Galaxy-Z-Flip-infographic.jpg" alt="Galaxy Z Flip infographic" width="640" height="1592" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Galaxy-Z-Flip-infographic.jpg 1000w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Galaxy-Z-Flip-infographic-161x400.jpg 161w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Galaxy-Z-Flip-infographic-173x430.jpg 173w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Galaxy-Z-Flip-infographic-768x1911.jpg 768w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Galaxy-Z-Flip-infographic-617x1536.jpg 617w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Galaxy-Z-Flip-infographic-823x2048.jpg 823w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" />
