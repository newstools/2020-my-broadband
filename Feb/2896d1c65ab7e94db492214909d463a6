Microsoft has announced price increases for its Office 365 Personal and Home products in South Africa. Starting from 19 February 2020, the annual subscription fee for Office 365 Personal will be increased from R899 to R999. It will also be available at a monthly rate of R99. Additionally, the annual subscription fee for Office 365 Home will increase from R1,199 to R1,399, or R139 per month. Users will be charged these new prices unless they choose to cancel their subscription before 19 February. The company said the increases were implemented to address “changing market conditions.” The Office 365 Personal package includes the Word, Excel, Powerpoint, Outlook, Publisher, and Outlook programs, in addition to the OneDrive cloud storage service and Skype video calling application. The Microsoft Office 365 price changes are detailed below: Microsoft previously told MyBroadband that piracy of its software is worse in South Africa and other African countries than in other parts of the world. Only a third of PCs shipped to Africa include genuine software, which makes the region a prime target for malware attacks and data breaches. Microsoft EMEA vice president of consumer and device sales Bradley Hopkinson said the company wants this to change. “We have high aspirations to bring piracy almost to zero across Africa. We see a world across Africa where we can get genuine Windows in excess of 80% and even higher,” Hopkinson said. To address this, Microsoft launched its Windows PC Affordability in Africa Initiative, which aims to reduce the prevalence of Microsoft software piracy in the African market.
