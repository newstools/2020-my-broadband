Samsung launched its latest generation of true wireless earphones at its Unpacked event in San Francisco on 11 February 2020. Named the Galaxy Buds+, the new earbuds deliver far better battery life than the previous generation, thanks to an 85mAh battery. They also offer better sound thanks to the implementation of a tweeter and woofer in each earbud, instead of the single driver present in the previous-generation Galaxy Buds. Samsung’s Galaxy Buds+ also include three microphones, allowing for clearer voice calls. Like the previous-generation Galaxy Buds, these new earbuds use Bluetooth 5 to connect to the user’s smartphone, and the charging case uses Qi wireless charging for power delivery. Samsung states that play time has increased to 11 hours for its new Galaxy Buds+, a significant improvement compared to the 6 hours promised by the previous-generation Galaxy Buds. When combined with their charging case, the Galaxy Buds+ will provide up to 22 hours of battery life. The Galaxy Buds+ will be priced at $149 and will come in three colours – black, white, and blue. The earbuds will launch on 14 February 2020. <img class="aligncenter wp-image-338406" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Galaxy-Buds-Infographic.jpg" alt="Galaxy Buds+ Infographic" width="640" height="1391" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Galaxy-Buds-Infographic.jpg 1000w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Galaxy-Buds-Infographic-184x400.jpg 184w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Galaxy-Buds-Infographic-198x430.jpg 198w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Galaxy-Buds-Infographic-768x1670.jpg 768w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Galaxy-Buds-Infographic-707x1536.jpg 707w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Galaxy-Buds-Infographic-942x2048.jpg 942w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" />
