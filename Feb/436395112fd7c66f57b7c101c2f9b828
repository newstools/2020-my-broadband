There is a high probability of load-shedding on Saturday, Eskom has announced on Twitter. “As we have lost additional generating units and experienced an increase in demand today, there is a high probability of load-shedding on Saturday,” said Eskom. “Should there be any deterioration in the system we may have to implement load-shedding at short notice.” Eskom attributes the high likelihood of load-shedding to unplanned outages and breakdowns totaling 10,799MW as of 16:00 on Friday, while it was simultaneously conducting planned maintenance totaling 7,000MW. “Eskom has embarked on an increased maintenance regime, which will help restore our generating plants to good health,” said Eskom. Due to this increased maintenance, there is also a possibility of increased load-shedding over the next 18 months, the national electricity supplier said. Eskom will provide an update on Saturday morning to let South Africans know which load-shedding stage has been adopted if load-shedding does take place. Eskom also offered a list of ways that South Africans can help reduce electricity demand:
