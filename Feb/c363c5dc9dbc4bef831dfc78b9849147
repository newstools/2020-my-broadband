Huawei has hit back at allegations by US officials, who said the Chinese company has the ability to access private information on mobile networks that use its equipment. “We have evidence that Huawei has the capability secretly to access sensitive and personal information in systems it maintains and sells around the world,” alleged the US officials. However, Huawei said that these allegations are incorrect and illogical. “US allegations of Huawei using lawful interception are nothing but a smokescreen—they don’t adhere to any form of accepted logic in the cybersecurity domain,” said Huawei. “Huawei has never and will never covertly access telecom networks, nor do we have the capability to do so.” Huawei also said the Wall Street Journal’s report highlights its bias against the global tech giant. “The Wall Street Journal is clearly aware that the US government can’t provide any evidence to support their allegations, and yet it still chose to repeat the lies being spread by these US officials.” “This reflects The Wall Street Journal’s bias against Huawei and undermines its credibility.” Huawei explained that it only provides equipment, meaning that it does not have any access to its customers’ networks. “Huawei is only an equipment supplier. In this role, accessing customer networks without their authorization and visibility would be impossible,” said Huawei. It added that, as is the case with other telecom equipment suppliers, it must follow “lawful interception standards” – but these interception interfaces are always located in protected premises which are owned and run by the operator. “We do not have the ability to bypass carriers, access control, and take data from their networks without being detected by all normal firewalls or security systems,” said Huawei. “In fact, even The Wall Street Journal admits that US officials are unable to provide any concrete details concerning these so-called ‘backdoors.'”
