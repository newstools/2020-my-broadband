Eskom stage 2 load-shedding will be implemented until 06:00 on Sunday, 16 February, said the company. This follows the sudden loss of generating units, with unplanned breakdowns or outages at 11,427MW. Eskom said it has lost four generating units, which, combined with planned maintenance, has forced it onto emergency reserves. Eskom said while it regrets having to implement load-shedding, South Africans have been made aware of the strained system which is vulnerable to any negative situation. It added that South Africans should expect the risk of load-shedding to persist for the next 18 months, at the least. Customers can find their load-shedding schedules on their local metro or municipal websites, where applicable, or from Eskom directly. For those living in South Africaâ€™s major metros, here is where you can check to see when you will be hit: For access to other load-shedding schedules, Eskom has made them available on loadshedding.eskom.co.za.
