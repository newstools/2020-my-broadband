MultiChoice recently announced its annual price adjustments for DStv, with the fees of several packages set to increase from 1 April 2020. Last year, for the first time ever, the price of a DStv Premium subscription did not increase. This year it will increase by R10 per month to R819. DStv Compact Plus subscriptions also increased by R10 per month to R529. The increase last year was 2% – also R10 per month. Statistics South Africa has determined that the average inflation for 2019 was 4.1%. This means that both the DStv Premium and Compact Plus increases are well below inflation. DStv Family and DStv Access will see more substantial increases percentage-wise. Subscribers on the DStv Family package will pay R279 per month. This is R14 more than last year – an increase of 5.9%. DStv Access has increased by 4.8%, from R105 to R110 per month. Both these increase are above the average inflation rate for 2019. The price of DStv Compact and DStv EasyView will not change in 2020.
