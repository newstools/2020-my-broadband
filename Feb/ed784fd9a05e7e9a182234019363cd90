Unfavourable conditions at sea have resulted in the team assigned to repair the SAT3/WASC and WACS submarine cables requiring an extra day for repairs. This is according to a media statement published by Openserve. “It was initially anticipated that this restoration portion of the SAT3/WASC repair will be completed by 17 February 2020 but it has now been rescheduled for completion on Tuesday 18 February,” said Openserve. “Thereafter, the ship will proceed to its next location, offshore Ghana, to undertake a power-related (shunt fault) repair on the WACS cable. If conditions allow, the mission is still set to be completed around 25 February.” Openserve said it will continue to maintain communications with the various parties involved in the repair job until both cable systems are running. This follows the South African National Research Network (SANReN) and the Tertiary Education and Research Network of South Africa (TENET) saying earlier today that repairs on the SAT3 and WACS cables are set to be finished on Sunday 16 February. While several South African ISPs were affected by the breaks, most international traffic has been diverted using additional capacity from SEACOM. MyBroadband’s speed tests show that Vodacom and MTN are almost unaffected by the issue, while Cell C and Rain’s international speeds are about half of their local speeds. Telkom’s international speeds have been reduced to 5% of its local speeds.
