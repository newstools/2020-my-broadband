President Cyril Ramaphosa delivered his fourth state of the nation address on Thursday, stating that the licensing of high demand spectrum will be concluded by the end of 2020. “An important condition for the success of our digital economy is the availability of high demand spectrum to expand broadband access and reliability,” Ramaphosa said. “The regulator, ICASA, has undertaken to conclude the licensing of high demand spectrum for industry via auction before the end of 2020.” He also punted lower data prices, saying the competition authorities are working with mobile operators to secure deep cuts to data prices across prepaid monthly bundles. He said additional discounts targeted at low-income households, the free daily allocation of data, and free access to educational and public interest websites will also be implemented. This sounds great and will make many people happy, but there is just one problem – we have heard this all before. Ramaphosa and his predecessors have been beating the “lower data prices” and spectrum drum for many years. Here is a look back at what former Presidents Thabo Mbeko, Jacob Zuma, and President Ramaphosa said about data prices over the past fifteen years. Many of the promises made in the state of the nation addresses did not materialise and gave people false hope. The main reason for this failure is that the government tried to use political tools like regulation and state-protected monopolies to provide better broadband services. These political interventions failed. What worked every time is competition, which is what is behind better broadband access, lower prices, and better service levels. The government would do well to focus on licensing spectrum and increasing competition to ensure better services and lower prices to consumers. It worked across the world, and it will work in South Africa. This is an opinion piece.
