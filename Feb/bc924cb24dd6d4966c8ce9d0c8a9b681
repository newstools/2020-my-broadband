British Airways has broken the New York-London subsonic flight speed record. The flight’s record-breaking speed was heavily influenced by 322km/h winds, which helped to propel the aircraft much faster than normal. “We always prioritise safety over speed records, but our highly trained pilots made the most of the conditions to get customers back to London well ahead of time,” British Airways said. The plane arrived at Heathrow airport about two hours sooner than scheduled and reached a top speed of 1,327km/h during the flight, according to data from Flightradar24. “If we’re not mistaken, BA now retakes the fastest subsonic NY-London crossing from Norwegian,” tweeted Flightradar24. Senior CNN meteorologist Brandon Miller said these significantly stronger winds have also pushed a dangerous storm to the UK and Ireland. “The supercharged jet stream is also responsible for powering Storm Ciara, which has brought damaging wind gusts and massive waves to the UK, Ireland and other parts of Northern Europe this weekend,” said Miller. “The jet stream is a fast-moving ‘river of air’ high in the atmosphere, around the height that commercial airliners fly. The jet stream is responsible for carrying weather systems around the planet.” The high winds saw other flights also surpass the previous New York-London record, including two flights by Virgin Atlantic. Virgin highlighted that these two flights achieved similar times to the British Airways flight while using half the fuel and half as many engines. “It’s true that we were narrowly beaten by a BA Boeing 747, however, they had twice the amount of engines and burnt twice as much fuel as Captain Chris in our brand new, fuel-efficient Airbus A350-1000,” tweeted Virgin Atlantic.
