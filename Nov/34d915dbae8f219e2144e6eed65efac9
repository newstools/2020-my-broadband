Shelly is a reliable, yet affordable smart home automation solution that allows you to intelligently control and manage your home through an Internet connection and intuitive mobile app. With the focus being on making life easier, the Shelly solution allows you to control your home appliances and office equipment, as well as monitor the power consumption of your appliances from anywhere with your smartphone or sensors placed around the home or office, which can be used as triggers. For example, you can set Shelly to automatically switch on your outdoor lights at sunset and automatically switch off at sunrise. Your Shelly 1 can automatically trigger your heater when the temperature drops below a certain value and Shelly Flood can instantly notify you of a burst geyser before costly damage is caused. Additionally, Shelly devices can also be set to perform multiple tasks with a single click or voice command (via Google Assistant or Amazon Alexa), such as drop the projector screen, dim the relevant lights and switch on the popcorn maker when you’re about to watch a movie. Shelly products are designed to offer maximum comfort, safety, and ease of installation. With their compact size, they offer some of the smallest designs in the world and have no issue fitting behind a light switch, out of sight. The only thing needed to use Shelly products is Wi-Fi, an Internet connection and the free, user-friendly Shelly Cloud mobile app which is available for both Android and iOS devices. The Shelly Cloud mobile app has a host of features, such as scheduling, timers, countdown, grouping or creating of scenes that can activate multiple actions with just one tap. <img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-374384" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Shelly-app_1-640x430.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="430" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Shelly-app_1.jpg 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Shelly-app_1-595x400.jpg 595w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Shelly-app_1-300x202.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> <img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-374386" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Shelly-app_2-640x430.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="430" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Shelly-app_2.jpg 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Shelly-app_2-595x400.jpg 595w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Shelly-app_2-300x202.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> All the Shelly products distributed by Nology have the required regulatory approvals and certifications and are sold through authorised resellers, retailers and installers throughout South Africa.
