While smartphones have a reputation for being expensive, there are many more affordable options available to South Africans. It is crucial to the development of South Africa that such affordable smartphones are available as it will increase smartphone uptake. ICT expert Charley Lewis previously told MyBroadband that the drive for smartphone uptake in South Africa is important for consumers as those who do not have these devices are deprived of access to much of the Internet and its benefits – such as highly useful apps. “If the pricing of entry-level smartphones can be kept low, and priced into pay-as-you-go plans, and with data prices poised to fall, I see no reason that there should not be an upsurge in smartphone demand,” said Lewis. “The benefits to universal access and service, and to the increased data revenues, are sure to the benefit of users and operators alike.” The benefits of modern technologies have been made even more obvious by the COVID-19 pandemic. Thankfully, there is therefore no need to fork out tens of thousands of rand if you seek the core functionality of a smartphone. If you are in the market for the most basic and affordable of smartphones, you can choose between a number of brands. We have detailed some of the most affordable smartphones in South Africa below. <img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-371095" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Mobicel-640x430.jpg" alt="Mobicel" width="640" height="430" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Mobicel-640x430.jpg 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Mobicel-595x400.jpg 595w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Mobicel-300x202.jpg 300w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Mobicel.jpg 762w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> <img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-371097" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Hisense-u605-640x430.jpg" alt="Hisense u605" width="640" height="430" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Hisense-u605-640x430.jpg 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Hisense-u605-595x400.jpg 595w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Hisense-u605-300x202.jpg 300w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Hisense-u605-768x516.jpg 768w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Hisense-u605.jpg 1114w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> <img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-371099" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/alcatel-640x430.jpg" alt="alcatel" width="640" height="430" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/alcatel-640x430.jpg 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/alcatel-595x400.jpg 595w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/alcatel-300x202.jpg 300w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/alcatel-768x516.jpg 768w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/alcatel.jpg 1190w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> <img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-371101" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/ZTE-640x430.jpg" alt="ZTE" width="640" height="430" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/ZTE-640x430.jpg 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/ZTE-595x400.jpg 595w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/ZTE-300x202.jpg 300w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/ZTE-768x516.jpg 768w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/ZTE.jpg 1068w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> <img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-371103" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/invens-640x430.jpg" alt="invens" width="640" height="430" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/invens-640x430.jpg 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/invens-595x400.jpg 595w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/invens-300x202.jpg 300w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/invens-768x516.jpg 768w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/invens.jpg 1141w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-256263" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Vodacom-Smart-Mini-7.jpg" alt="Vodacom Smart Mini 7" width="640" height="430" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Vodacom-Smart-Mini-7.jpg 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Vodacom-Smart-Mini-7-300x202.jpg 300w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Vodacom-Smart-Mini-7-595x400.jpg 595w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> <img class="aligncenter wp-image-371105" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Hisense-Infinity-U40.jpg" alt="Hisense Infinity U40" width="639" height="430" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Hisense-Infinity-U40.jpg 571w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Hisense-Infinity-U40-300x202.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" />
