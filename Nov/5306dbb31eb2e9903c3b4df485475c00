In a year like no other, it is likely that 2020’s Black Friday and Cyber Monday deals will be more frenzied than ever. With many industries, particularly retail, crippled by pandemic lockdowns and distancing restrictions, the upcoming weekend presents an opportunity to recoup some losses. The pandemic has accelerated the already growing increase in online shopping, with e-commerce sales expected to reach $4.2 trillion by the end of 2020. Although many physical stores will be closed or keeping the usual crowds of shoppers to a minimum – the online space will be just as jam-packed as ever with offers and sales. This makes it the perfect breeding ground for cyber-attacks and scams, from phishing emails to suspicious social media ads. For many, mobile devices have become the primary method for online shopping, so it is vital that consumers are protected across all technologies. “Shopping online presents risks and some of that frenzy on Black Friday and Cyber Monday will extend to the internet, especially as all that bargain-hunting can cause you to let your guard down” says Carey van Vlaanderen, CEO at ESET South Africa. “In fact, many people openly admit to taking risks at the prospect of a deal. Those ‘too-good-to-be-true’ items may leave you exposed to a range of threats that typically aim to capture your financial information.” Here are ESET’s top five tips for what to watch out for and to stay safe this Black Friday and Cyber Monday: ESET is offering a Black Friday and Cyber Monday deal for the ESET Internet Security product – if you purchase ESET Internet Security between 23 – 30 November you will get 25% off.
