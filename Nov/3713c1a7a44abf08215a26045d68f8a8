South Africaâ€™s new National List of Occupations in High Demand (OIHD) revealed that numerous ICT skills are in short supply in South Africa. Higher education minister, Blade Nzimande said the list is updated every two years and helps the country to understand the needs of the labour market. It gives a good indication on which occupations are likely to have vacancies and grow due to new investments, especially by the government. He added that this list can guide students and graduates towards the fields where they stand the best chance of employment. There are currently 345 occupations that are in high demand in South Africa out of 1.500 registered in the Organising Framework for Occupations. Nzimande said these include careers in the digital economy, like data scientists, web developers, and computer network technicians. He has urged universities, colleges, and private education and training institutions to use the list to inform their selection of programme offerings, resource allocations, and enrolment planning processes. He said it will also help in identifying and developing new qualifications and programmes that are more responsive to the needs of the economy and society. The National List of Occupations in High Demand includes numerous ICT professions, including software developers, ICT systems analysts, and multimedia specialists. Database designers and administrators, systems administrator, network analysts, and security specialists also have a bright future in South Africa. The table below provides an overview of the prominent ICT professions listed in the OIHD document.
