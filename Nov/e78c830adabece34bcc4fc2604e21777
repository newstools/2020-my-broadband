While allowing you to stay productive, conventional desktop PCs can take up a lot of space and be difficult to move around your home or office when needed. Fortunately, major advancements in manufacturing processes have helped to scale down computer hardware to deliver reliable performance in smaller forms. Elitegroup Computer System (ECS) in Partnership with Centurion Micro Electronics (CME) offers the perfect solution for those seeking strong computing performance in a compact and lightweight solution – the Liva Mini PC. LIVA PCs are mini PCs which defy conventions about what a desktop computer should look like. The LIVA Z2V, for example, is smaller than a lunchbox and takes up less volume than a large soda can, making it one of the smallest mini PCs of its kind. <img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-376831" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Liva-Z2V-640x430.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="430" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Liva-Z2V.jpg 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Liva-Z2V-595x400.jpg 595w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Liva-Z2V-300x202.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> It comes with Windows 10 Pro installed and is powered by a quad-core Intel N4100 processor paired with 4GB of RAM and 64GB of eMMC storage. LIVA PCs also offer a dual storage design with a super-fast 64GB eMMC M.2 drive, and an additional 2.5-inch hard drive bay providing space for an additional 1TB storage, enabling you to store your movies and media on the device as well. The LIVA Z2V has no shortage of ports for connecting peripherals, media storage, and output devices. Included are 3 x USB 3.1 and 2 x USB 2.0 Type-A ports, as well as a USB 3.1 Type-C port ensuring you won’t need a USB Hub ever again. For video output, users have the option of an HDMI or VGA port, while an Ethernet port and Wi-Fi will keep you connected to the internet. <img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-376837" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Liva-Z2V-Ultra-Compact-PC_front-640x430.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="430" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Liva-Z2V-Ultra-Compact-PC_front.jpg 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Liva-Z2V-Ultra-Compact-PC_front-595x400.jpg 595w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Liva-Z2V-Ultra-Compact-PC_front-300x202.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> <img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-376839" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Liva-Z2V-Ultra-Compact-PC_back-640x430.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="430" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Liva-Z2V-Ultra-Compact-PC_back.jpg 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Liva-Z2V-Ultra-Compact-PC_back-595x400.jpg 595w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Liva-Z2V-Ultra-Compact-PC_back-300x202.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> The LIVA’s compact size is perfect for use in an office environment, as a thin-client in service centres, point-of-sale devices or for digital signage. With VESA mounting you can attach the LIVA either at the back of a display or out of sight. The Kensington Lock also provides additional safety, allowing you to attach the unit to a non-movable item. It can also be used in meeting rooms for presentations by connecting the unit to the projector and presentations can be plugged directly into the Mini PC with a flash drive. The LIVA Z2V is also perfect for schools and universities by providing a complete computer for students to use. If institutions prefer to install their own Windows licenses, the LIVAs are also available without Windows pre-installed. <img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-376841" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/LIVA-Z-640x430.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="430" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/LIVA-Z.jpg 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/LIVA-Z-595x400.jpg 595w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/LIVA-Z-300x202.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> The LIVA Z Mini PC redefines the look of a desktop PC while only using 10% of the power and offering similar performance.
