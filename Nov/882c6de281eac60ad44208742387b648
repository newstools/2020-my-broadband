Cloud backup provider Backblaze has released its hard drive reliability statistics for the third quarter of 2020. The company compiled the report from data on the active hard drives used in its daily operations – including Seagate, Toshiba, and HGST. Reliability was measured as an annualised failure rate, calculated using the number of drive failures relative to the number of active drive days for each disk. Backblaze recorded the number of failures for each hard drive from 1 July to 30 September 2020, extrapolating the annualised failure rate from this data. The company tested a total of 150,757 hard drives this quarter, equating to a total of 13,290,884 days worth of hard drive operation across all products. Backblaze said the Q3 2020 annualized failure rate of 0.89% is slightly higher than last quarter’s 0.81% but significantly lower than the 2.07% from a year ago. “As of September 30, 2020, Backblaze had 153,727 spinning hard drives in our cloud storage ecosystem spread across four data centres,” Backblaze said. “Of that number, there were 2,780 boot drives and 150,947 data drives.” Backblaze excluded drives for which it did not have at least 60 models from the comparison. The most reliable hard drives for Q3 2020 are listed below, along with their annualised failure rates calculated from their performance during the quarter. The table below shows the reliability of hard drive models Backblaze had in service as of 30 September 2020. The reporting period is from 1 April 2013 through 30 September 2020.
