MultiChoice has rolled out its new DStv Rewards programme, which gives subscribers the ability to earn discounts on DStv products. The company said that free package upgrades for qualifying subscribers are among the offers available. This rewards system was first announced in August 2020 and has now officially gone live for all DStv customers. “The newly-launched DStv Rewards gives subscribers the chance to receive more of the content they love with specials upgrades and customer discounts as well as benefits from BoxOffice, Showmax, and other DStv related products and services,” DStv said in a blog post. “We want to keep customers entertained, on the couch and off, with access to live events and much more to make the DStv experience, even better.” Subscribers can sign up for the DStv Rewards programme through the MyDStv app at no additional charge. DStv said that customers can earn rewards points – called “stars” – based on the following: There are four rewards levels, which are classified as follows: <img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-375837" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/stars-640x92.jpg" alt="stars" width="640" height="92" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/stars-640x92.jpg 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/stars-600x87.jpg 600w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/stars-768x111.jpg 768w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/stars.jpg 1074w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> Subscribers with a higher number of stars are eligible for more offers, which include “rent one, get one free” on Box Office, Uber Eats vouchers, Showmax discounts, free package upgrades, and more. “Some rewards are ongoing discounts and offers that’ll be yours every month for as long as you’re an active subscriber at that reward level,” DStv said. “Aside from earning stars, rewards members can look forward to challenges and competitions to get even more rewards.” “Once you have joined rewards, DStv will also alert you to new offers, challenges, competitions and rewards via email, SMS or notifications via the MyDStv app.” DStv customers can check their Rewards level and offers by signing in to the MyDStv app and selecting the Rewards icon to join. They will then be redirected to the Rewards dashboard which will reveal how many starts they have and which special offers they can claim.
