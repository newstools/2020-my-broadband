Apple is already working on a successor to its recently-unveiled M1 ARM laptop chipset. This is according to LeaksApplePro, who stated on Twitter that the new processor is currently under development and is currently code-named the “Apple M1X”. The leak stated that the chip will boast a total of 12 cores: eight high-performance cores with four high-efficiency cores, mirroring the same big-little architecture of the M1 chip while boosting the number of processing units. The new chipset will reportedly launch within a 16-inch MacBook Pro that Apple will unveil in a press release once development is completed. A source purportedly told the leaker that “if you think M1 is fast, you haven’t seen M1X”, pointing to a dramatic improvement in performance over the previously-unveiled chip. This is impressive, considering the performance improvements Apple states the M1 chip has over the previous Intel processors it has used in its laptops. There is currently no confirmed released date for this upcoming “Apple M1X” chipset. The Apple M1 is the first system-on=chip built specifically for Mac devices, and it uses an ARM microarchitecture as well as a unified memory architecture for improved performance and power efficiency. It is the first computer chip built using 5nm processor technology and combines high-performance and high-efficiency cores for maximising efficiency and performance. Apple states that the M1 chipset offers the world’s best CPU performance per watt, outpacing all of its rivals in power efficiency. There is also an integrated graphics unit in the Apple M1, which has eight physical cores that deliver a total of 2.6 teraflops of performance. Apple said that when it comes to personal computers, M1 has the world’s fastest integrated graphics. This new M1 chipset is the first iteration in what will be a new range of chips that will end up powering all of Apple’s Mac devices in future. Apple M1X: -12 Cores. – 8 performance cores. – 4 high efficiency cores. – Coming first on a MacBook Pro
