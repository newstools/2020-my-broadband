The Department of Higher Education and Training has published the National List of Occupations in High Demand for 2020. This document details the occupations which have been identified as being in high demand at the national level. “It is intended to inform decision-making in relation to a wide range of issues pertaining to, inter alia, education and training,” the department said. The department added that the primary purpose of the list is to improve the tertiary education system to address the needs of the South African economy. The list is reviewed every two years unless it is deemed necessary to do so earlier. “The Department of Higher Education will publish its next list of occupations in high demand in 2022,” the department said. The department defines the occupations in this list as follows: Occupations in high demand refer to those occupations that show relatively high employment growth based on past, present and future trends and that are currently in shortage.
