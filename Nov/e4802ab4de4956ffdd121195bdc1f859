Google, Teraco, Telkom, and Dimension data have pledged a combined investment of R15.5 billion at the third annual South Africa Investment Conference. The Investment Conference took place at the Sandton Convention Centre this week, where 50 companies have pledged combined investments of R109.6 billion. The latest pledges bring the total amount of investment pledges to R773.6 billion worth of investments in the last three years. With this total amount, South Africa has now reached 64% of its total investment target of R1.2 trillion. President Cyril Ramaphosa said considering the subdued economic climate, securing investment commitments of over R100 billion is a remarkable achievement. The investments are spread across various sectors in South Africa, including manufacturing, property, and telecoms. A few of the noteworthy investment commitments include: When looking at the technology and telecoms sectors, Google, Teraco, Telkom, and Dimension Data committed to large investments. Teraco Data Environments committed R4.4 billion to build a new hyperscale data centre with 38MW of critical power load in Ekurhuleni, South Africa. The new Teraco facility is called JB4 and will be the largest data centre in Africa once it is built. NTT and Dimension Data pledged R875 million to expand their respective data centre infrastructure in Gauteng. The new Dimension Data Johannesburg 1 Data Centre is designed according to tier 3 standards and will be constructed in two phases. When fully built, it will deliver a total of 6,000 square meters of IT space and 12MW of IT load. The first phase of the site is scheduled to become operational at the beginning of 2022. Google said it will spend R2.2 billion in a fibre optics submarine cable in the Western Cape that will provide high-speed internet connectivity across South Africa. Telkom committed the most through its pledge to spend R8 billion to expand its infrastructure across the country.
