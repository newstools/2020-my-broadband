Spotify has announced that it has launched its annual Premium holiday offer, which allows users to sign up for three months at a once-off cost of only R60. The streaming service will also offer three months of free Spotify Premium to eligible free and first-time users. “Beginning today through December 31, Spotify Premium is offering three months free to eligible Spotify Free and first-time users who are new to Premium across the Individual Premium plan,” Spotify said. “For those who are missing their Individual Premium plan and cancelled for one reason or another, Spotify is offering three months for R59.99.” Both offers are available for the Individual Premium plan, and sign-ups for the offer will be available from today until 31 December.
