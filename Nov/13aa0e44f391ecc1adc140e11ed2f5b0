AMD’s Ryzen 5000 processors are now available in South Africa from leading tech retailers Wootware and Evetech. Both stores have listed all four processors on their websites; however, at Wootware, only the Ryzen 5 5600X is in stock, and as a result, the pricing is not provided for the other processors. Across both Wootware and Evetech, the Ryzen 5 5600X – the most affordable of these processors – costs R6,199. The most expensive of this processor range, the Ryzen 9 5950X, costs R17,5999. The pricing of each of these processors across Wootware and Evetech is detailed below. These processors are built on a 7nm+ manufacturing process and are based on AMD’s Zen 3 CPU microarchitecture. AMD said that this new microarchitecture enables these processors to offer the best single-threaded and gaming performance of any desktop chips. “Zen 3 increases our lead in overall performance, it increases our lead in power efficiency, and also now it delivers the best single-threaded performance and gaming performance as well”, said AMD CEO Lisa Su. There are four new processors in this range: AMD noted that its best processor – the Ryzen 5950X – broke the Cinebench R20 single-threaded record with a score of 640, which was significantly higher than the performance of the Intel Core i9 10900K – which scored 544. AMD CTO Mark Papermaster said that this new generation of processors offers the most significant architectural upgrade across the Zen families of processors. “It is a beast in performance and will deliver absolute leadership in the x86 market,” Papermaster said. He explained the processors offer the following key improvements: Papermaster added that the Zen 3 architecture delivers 24% better power efficiency compared with the prior generation, making it 2.8x more efficient than Intel’s flagship Core i9-10900K processor. A new layout of the Ryzen 5000 series’ processors ensures that all cores are unified into a single, eight-core complex. This accelerates core to core communications and makes these processors much better for gaming than their predecessors. This includes 28% improved performance by the Ryzen 9 5900X when playing Shadow Tomb Raider compared to its predecessor. Double-digit improvements were also experienced by a variety of popular games including League of Legends, PUBG, DOTA 2, F1 2019, Far Cry: New Dawn, and CS:GO.
