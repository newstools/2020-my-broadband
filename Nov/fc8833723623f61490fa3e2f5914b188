The Raspberry Pi Foundation has launched its latest Raspberry Pi mini-computer – the Raspberry Pi 400. This design of this device differs from previous models, comprising a Pi mini-computer that is built into a tenkeyless keyboard. This design is inspired by the classic PCs of the 1980s, and it houses a faster and cooler 4GB Raspberry Pi 4 mini computer. This means that it boasts a quad-core 64-bit processor, 4GB of RAM, Wi-Fi and Bluetooth connectivity, as well as the standard 40-pin GPIO header sported by many devices in the Raspberry Pi lineup. “Raspberry Pi 4, which we launched in June last year, is roughly forty times as powerful as the original Raspberry Pi, and offers an experience that is indistinguishable from a legacy PC for the majority of users,” the Raspberry Pi Foundation said. “Particularly since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, we’ve seen a rapid increase in the use of Raspberry Pi 4 for home working and studying.” At launch, the Pi 400 is available in English UK, English US, French, Italian, German and Spanish keyboard layouts. The Raspberry Pi 400 is priced at only $70, or $100 for a Raspberry Pi 400 Personal Computer Kit. The kit includes the following hardware: Specifications and images of the new Raspberry Pi 400 are shown below. <img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-374048" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Raspberry-Pi-400-3-640x430.jpg" alt="Raspberry Pi 400 3" width="640" height="430" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Raspberry-Pi-400-3.jpg 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Raspberry-Pi-400-3-595x400.jpg 595w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Raspberry-Pi-400-3-300x202.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> <img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-374046" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Raspberry-Pi-400-2-640x430.jpg" alt="Raspberry Pi 400 2" width="640" height="430" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Raspberry-Pi-400-2.jpg 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Raspberry-Pi-400-2-595x400.jpg 595w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Raspberry-Pi-400-2-300x202.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> <img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-374044" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Raspberry-Pi-400-1-640x430.jpg" alt="Raspberry Pi 400 1" width="640" height="430" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Raspberry-Pi-400-1.jpg 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Raspberry-Pi-400-1-595x400.jpg 595w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Raspberry-Pi-400-1-300x202.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> <img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-374050" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Raspberry-Pi-400-kit-640x345.jpg" alt="Raspberry Pi 400 kit" width="640" height="345" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Raspberry-Pi-400-kit-640x345.jpg 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Raspberry-Pi-400-kit-600x323.jpg 600w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Raspberry-Pi-400-kit-768x414.jpg 768w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Raspberry-Pi-400-kit-1536x827.jpg 1536w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Raspberry-Pi-400-kit-2048x1103.jpg 2048w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Raspberry-Pi-400-kit-1200x646.jpg 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" />
