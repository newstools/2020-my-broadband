Dell’s online event will focus on why and how South African organisations should prioritise digital transformation – a topic which has become particularly relevant since the national lockdown started. Many organisations have already experienced the extensive benefits of digital transformation, but it is important that they continue along this path. Organisations which have fallen behind in their digital transformation journey have suffered, and it is equally critical that they push towards their digital transformation goals. The Dell Technologies Forum 2020 will accordingly offer insight into the digital transformation process through its keynote presentations, breakout sessions, and networking opportunities. There will be a total of 27 breakout sessions which are conducted by industry visionaries, Dell Technologies leaders, and a variety of other experts. Additional opportunities available to attendees include: The event will be hosted by Dell Technologies South Africa Managing Director Doug Woolley, while Dell Technologies Global CTO John Roese will deliver the keynote address. Attendees will also hear a pre-recorded address by Dell Technologies Chairman and CEO Michael Dell.
