The Ajax security system is ideal for protecting your home, apartment or office from dangers like burglaries, flooding, and fires. Built with ground-breaking technology with functional design, and using the best components available, the wireless solution boasts smart, reliable, and fast performance. It comprises a wide variety of sensors and detectors with cameras, and alarms which can be placed throughout your home. Once set up, this will provide a 24/7 overview of your home via a convenient, intuitive mobile app. If anything happens, Ajax will notify you and your security company immediately and help prevent potential devastation such as damage to or loss of property. Ajax provided us with nine of its security devices for our own hands-on impressions. We were left impressed by the refined, compact design of each item, as well as the extensive range of features, as outlined below: <img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-373612" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Ajax-Home-Security_collection-in-boxes-637x430.jpg" alt="Ajax Home Security_collection in boxes" width="637" height="430" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Ajax-Home-Security_collection-in-boxes-637x430.jpg 637w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Ajax-Home-Security_collection-in-boxes-593x400.jpg 593w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Ajax-Home-Security_collection-in-boxes-300x202.jpg 300w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Ajax-Home-Security_collection-in-boxes-768x518.jpg 768w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Ajax-Home-Security_collection-in-boxes-1536x1037.jpg 1536w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Ajax-Home-Security_collection-in-boxes-1200x810.jpg 1200w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Ajax-Home-Security_collection-in-boxes.jpg 1600w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> The devices are equipped with digital algorithms and multi-factor models for threat detection, while eliminating the possibility of false alarms. The system also employs Ajax’s proprietary Jeweller radio protocol, which allows for connecting detectors to the hub up to 2,000 metres away and enables transmission of alarms within 0.15 seconds. In addition, pre-installed detector unit batteries can operate for up to 7 years before replacement. Transmitted data is encrypted at every step using a floating key encryption algorithm, too, while radio jamming and interference can also be detected. There are also several communication channels available, including Ethernet, Wi-Fi, and two 2G/3G/4G SIM-card slots (may vary depending on the hub version). These work in parallel and back each other up in case of an emergency. The free Ajax app for Android and iOS makes it easy to manage the system remotely. The user can arm or disarm the system with a few taps, as well as switch on appliances connected to Ajax smart sockets before they get home. The app also allows users to: Below is a more detailed overview of each Ajax device  we were provided with. <img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-373644" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Ajax-Home-Security_Control-panel-637x430.jpg" alt="Ajax Home Security_Hub 2 Plus" width="637" height="430" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Ajax-Home-Security_Control-panel-637x430.jpg 637w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Ajax-Home-Security_Control-panel-593x400.jpg 593w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Ajax-Home-Security_Control-panel-300x202.jpg 300w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Ajax-Home-Security_Control-panel-768x518.jpg 768w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Ajax-Home-Security_Control-panel-1536x1037.jpg 1536w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Ajax-Home-Security_Control-panel-1200x810.jpg 1200w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Ajax-Home-Security_Control-panel.jpg 1600w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> All of the sensors and detectors in the system connect to this central control panel, which in turn can communicate with your app and security companies. For communication, it uses four independent  channels consisting of Ethernet, Wi-Fi, and dual-SIM 2G/3G/LTE connectivity to ensure that your system is always connected. Switching between channels happens seamlessly in seconds. It supports 64 scenarios that minimise human impact on the security of a location – including automatically arming and disarming the entire security system or certain groups by schedule. Hub 2 Plus also supports MotionCam detectors with photo verification due to Wings radio protocol support. Wings is developed for fast transmission of visual data over vast distances. Built-in algorithms of package checking and re-uploading allow Wings to deliver photos at a distance of up to 1,700 meters, even if the signal level is unstable. <img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-373620" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Ajax-Home-Security_camera-637x430.jpg" alt="Ajax Home Security_camera" width="637" height="430" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Ajax-Home-Security_camera-637x430.jpg 637w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Ajax-Home-Security_camera-593x400.jpg 593w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Ajax-Home-Security_camera-300x202.jpg 300w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Ajax-Home-Security_camera-768x518.jpg 768w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Ajax-Home-Security_camera-1536x1037.jpg 1536w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Ajax-Home-Security_camera-1200x810.jpg 1200w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Ajax-Home-Security_camera.jpg 1600w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> This motion detector comes with a photo camera to verify raised alarms. It can transmit a photo at up to 1,700m from the hub in under 9 seconds. All transmissions are encrypted and seen only by the user. The motion detector is unable to take pictures by request. The camera activates only in response to a motion alarm. You won’t need to live under the constant supervision of the security cameras to know why the alarm went off. The pre-installed batteries on the MotionCam will  last for up to 4 years before replacement is needed. <img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-373622" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Ajax-Home-Security_door-sensor-637x430.jpg" alt="Ajax Home Security_door sensor" width="637" height="430" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Ajax-Home-Security_door-sensor-637x430.jpg 637w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Ajax-Home-Security_door-sensor-593x400.jpg 593w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Ajax-Home-Security_door-sensor-300x202.jpg 300w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Ajax-Home-Security_door-sensor-768x518.jpg 768w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Ajax-Home-Security_door-sensor-1536x1037.jpg 1536w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Ajax-Home-Security_door-sensor-1200x810.jpg 1200w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Ajax-Home-Security_door-sensor.jpg 1600w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> This wireless opening detector notifies of the first signs of room intrusion by means of a broken/open door or window.
