These specials include daily deals that run until 26 November, Smart Price deals that run until 29 November, and Extended Black Friday deals that will run until 6 December. This follows the online-only deals Pick n Pay launched on 13 November. “We’ve secured the best deals on essentials and popular Black Friday buys,” said retail executive for marketing John Bradshaw. “Customers are encouraged to swipe their Smart Shopper card to unlock Smart Price Black Friday savings, but we will have plenty of other deals offering huge savings.” “Similar to past Black Fridays, many customers will use it as an opportunity to hunt for some great deals, particularly on clothing, appliances and electronics.” Pick n Pay added that its official on-demand grocery and liquor delivery app, Bottles, will load new Black Friday deals every day for delivery nationwide within as little as one hour. Customers will be able to order up to 50 items with a limit of six per item. Pick n Pay said in preparation for its biggest Black Friday yet, it has stocked up on products, bolstered its staff capacity, employed additional in-store safety measures, and provided more online shopping options.
