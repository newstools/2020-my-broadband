The next shipment of PlayStation 5 consoles is on its way to South Africa, and another round of pre-orders is set to begin. Koodoo has announced that the next drop of PlayStation 5 consoles is coming soon, and pre-orders will go live on its website at 08:00 on Friday 13 November. The retailer said the expected delivery date for the next round of PlayStation 5 pre-orders is between 16 and 20 December. Koodoo is the online retailer operated by Gamefinity – the official distributor of PlayStation 5 consoles in South Africa. “The PlayStation 5 units are on their way to us from Europe,” Koodoo said. “Whilst we will make every effort to get your PlayStation 5 to you before Christmas, we, unfortunately, cannot guarantee this due to potential supply chain challenges into the country.” PlayStation 5 pre-orders overwhelmed stock levels soon after they first went live in September. The PS5 and PS5 Digital Edition consoles sold out in a matter of minutes at many retailers, with stock being extremely limited compared to the new Xbox Series X and Series S in South Africa. “Our PS5 Standard Console Pre-Order went live at 9:30 AM and sold out four minutes later,” Raru previously told MyBroadband. “If you look at what has happened globally with PS5 pre-orders, any retailer which does manage to secure PS5 Console pre-order stock can expect these to sell out extremely quickly.” Fans who have not yet ordered a PlayStation 5 are encouraged to do so as quickly as possible when pre-orders reopen on Friday before stock runs out. <img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-375252" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Koodoo-PS5-pre-order-640x360.jpg" alt="Koodoo PS5 pre-order" width="640" height="360" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Koodoo-PS5-pre-order-640x360.jpg 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Koodoo-PS5-pre-order-600x338.jpg 600w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Koodoo-PS5-pre-order-768x432.jpg 768w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Koodoo-PS5-pre-order.jpg 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" />
