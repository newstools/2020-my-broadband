Huawei’s first Wi-Fi 6 Plus router – the AX3 – will be available in South Africa from 1 December. This powerful router supports fast download speeds of up to 3,000Mbps with compatible devices, in addition to much-improved wall penetration for wider coverage around your home or office. With support for the Wi-Fi 6 (802.11ax) standard, this router can achieve significantly better performance than Wi-Fi 5 (802.11ac) routers. This provides the following benefits over old routers: Huawei’s significant investment in network communications technologies means its products can support capabilities over and beyond the Wi-Fi 6 standard. By integrating unique chip collaboration technologies in their Gigahome Wi-Fi chips, their frequency bandwidth support is improved to up to 160MHz. This realises on-demand automatic packet fragmentation in narrow-band mode via dynamic narrow-band technology, a feature which Huawei has called Wi-Fi 6 Plus. Wi-Fi 6 Plus devices benefit from faster network connectivity closer to the router, in addition to more stable connections from further distances. The best performance can be expected when used in conjunction with compatible Huawei devices – including smartphones, tablets, and computers. There are two AX3 models available – one with a dual-core processor and another model with a quad-core chip The main features that the quad-core AX model adds are: The dual-core Huawei AX3 router will be available in South Africa from 1 December at a price of R1,499, while the quad-core model will go on sale in 2021.
