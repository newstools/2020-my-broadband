Huawei’s powerful new Wi-Fi AX3 router is now available for pre-order in South Africa. As the company’s first Wi-Fi 6 Plus router, it supports download speeds of up to 3,000Mbps with compatible devices, in addition to much-improved wall penetration. Wi-Fi 6 (802.11ax) is a new-generation Wi-Fi standard which is supported by orthogonal frequency division multiple access (OFDMA). It offers the following benefits over the Wi-Fi 5 standard (802.11ac): Thanks to its long-term investment in Wi-Fi technologies, Huawei not only offers products that support the Wi-Fi 6 standard, they also integrate unique chip collaboration technologies using their self-developed Gigahome Wi-Fi chips. The Gigahome Wi-Fi 6 chipset in the AX3 improves the frequency bandwidth to up to 160MHz, and realises on-demand automatic packet fragmentation in narrow-band mode via dynamic narrow-band technology. The overall result is not only faster network connectivity closer to the router, but also more stable connections from further distances. Additionally, the quad-core AX model adds features like HuaweiShare for one tap connections to the Wi-Fi network and Huawei HomeSec security to protect against brute-force attacks. Its optimal performance can be achieved when used in conjunction with compatible Huawei Wi-Fi 6 devices – including smartphones, tablets, and computers. The Huawei AX3 router will ensure your home or office’s Wi-Fi network is as fast and reliable as any current technologies allow. Pre-order it now on the Huawei Online Store or Incredible Connection at R1,499.
