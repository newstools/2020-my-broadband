Minister of Cooperative Governance and Corporate Affairs Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma has published the updated alert level 1 lockdown regulations for South Africa. This follows an address by President Cyril Ramaphosa on 11 November, where he said that certain level 1 lockdown regulations would be eased. Changes include the removal of restricted trading hours for businesses – including retail outlets and the sale of alcohol. “We recognise that some industries are still not able to operate fully and that it will take some time for many jobs to return,” Ramaphosa said. He said that even as restrictions on the sale of alcohol are lifted further, excessive alcohol consumption is a hindrance in the country’s fight against the coronavirus. The national state of disaster has been extended to 15 December to enable the continued enforcement of lockdown regulations in South Africa. The full list of changes in the new level 1 lockdown regulations is shown below. The updated lockdown level 1 regulations are embedded below.
