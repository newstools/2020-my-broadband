When comparing the specifications of these smartwatches, it is immediately evident that the Huawei Watch GT 2 Pro has a major advantage in battery life. While the Watch Series 6 offers 18 hours of usage per charge, the Huawei smartwatch blows this out the water with a remarkable 14 days of use. Additionally, Huawei’s quick charge technology ensures that a 5-minute charge can power your Watch GT 2 Pro for up to 10 hours. The combination of this incredible battery life and impressive quick charge functionality means that you will almost never need to worry about your Huawei Watch GT 2 Pro running out of battery.
